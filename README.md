| **[Robust and Efficient Transfer Learning via Supernet Transfer in Warm-started Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20279v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-designing Neural Networks is a tedious process that requires significant expertise. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks offer a very useful and popular solution that helps to democratize AI. However, these NAS frameworks are often computationally expensive to run, which limits their applicability and accessibility. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, capable of effectively transferring pretrained supernets based on Optimal Transport or multi-dataset pretaining. This method can be generally applied to NAS methods based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). Through extensive experiments across dozens of image classification tasks, we demonstrate that transferring pretrained supernets in this way can not only drastically speed up the supernet training which then finds optimal models (3 to 5 times faster on average), but even yield that outperform those found when running DARTS methods from scratch. We also observe positive transfer to almost all target datasets, making it very robust. Besides drastically improving the applicability of NAS methods, this also opens up new applications for continual learning and related fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[DNAD: Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20080v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FX-DARTS: Designing Topology-unconstrained Architectures with Differentiable Architecture Search and Entropy-based Super-network Shrinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20079v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16306v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Unsupervised Network Architecture Search Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11140v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in scientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has three main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer. While the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of solution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc, leaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an unsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed PINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to find the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural networks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture parameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of PINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our approach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior usage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as the associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on several benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers' equations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS achieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting observation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a prominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that architectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior performance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architect of the Bits World: Masked Autoregressive Modeling for Circuit Generation Guided by Truth Table](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12751v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic synthesis, a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA), optimizes gate-level circuits to minimize power consumption and area occupancy in integrated circuits (ICs). Traditional logic synthesis tools rely on human-designed heuristics, often yielding suboptimal results. Although differentiable architecture search (DAS) has shown promise in generating circuits from truth tables, it faces challenges such as high computational complexity, convergence to local optima, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Consequently, we propose a novel approach integrating conditional generative models with DAS for circuit generation. Our approach first introduces CircuitVQ, a circuit tokenizer trained based on our Circuit AutoEncoder We then develop CircuitAR, a masked autoregressive model leveraging CircuitVQ as the tokenizer. CircuitAR can generate preliminary circuit structures from truth tables, which guide DAS in producing functionally equivalent circuits. Notably, we observe the scalability and emergent capability in generating complex circuit structures of our CircuitAR models. Extensive experiments also show the superior performance of our method. This research bridges the gap between probabilistic generative models and precise circuit generation, offering a robust solution for logic synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[EM-DARTS: Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14432v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics has received increasing attention thanks to its highly secure identification. Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Channel Allocation for Robust Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04681v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and significant improvement in efficiency. However, the excessive accumulation of the skip connection, when training epochs become large, makes it suffer from weak stability and low robustness, thus limiting its practical applications. Many works have attempted to restrict the accumulation of skip connections by indicators or manual design. These methods, however, are susceptible to human priors and hyper-parameters. In this work, we suggest a more subtle and direct approach that no longer explicitly searches for skip connections in the search stage, based on the paradox that skip connections were proposed to guarantee the performance of very deep networks, but the networks in the search stage of differentiable architecture search are actually very shallow. Instead, by introducing channel importance ranking and channel allocation strategy, the skip connections are implicitly searched and automatically refilled unimportant channels in the evaluation stage. Our method, dubbed Adaptive Channel Allocation (ACA) strategy, is a general-purpose approach for differentiable architecture search, which universally works in DARTS variants without introducing human priors, indicators, or hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets and DARTS variants verify that the ACA strategy is the most effective one among existing methods in improving robustness and dealing with the collapse issue when training epochs become large.</p></details> | Accepted by TNNLS |
| **[An Architectural Approach to Enhance Deep Long-Tailed Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06098v3)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep long-tailed recognition has been widely studied to address the issue of imbalanced data distributions in real-world scenarios. However, there has been insufficient focus on the design of neural architectures, despite empirical evidence suggesting that architecture can significantly impact performance. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate long-tailed issues through architectural improvements. To simplify the design process, we utilize Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, existing DARTS methods struggle to perform well in long-tailed scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Long-Tailed Differential Architecture Search (LTDAS). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to explore architectural components that demonstrate better performance on long-tailed data and propose a new search space based on our observations. This ensures that the architecture obtained through our search process incorporates superior components. Additionally, we propose replacing the learnable linear classifier with an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to further enhance our method. This classifier effectively alleviates the biased search process and prevents performance collapse. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently improves upon existing methods from an orthogonal perspective and achieves state-of-the-art results with simple enhancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable architecture search with multi-dimensional attention for spiking neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00902v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained enormous popularity in the field of artificial intelligence due to their low power consumption. However, the majority of SNN methods directly inherit the structure of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), usually leading to sub-optimal model performance in SNNs. To alleviate this problem, we integrate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method and propose Multi-Attention Differentiable Architecture Search (MA-DARTS) to directly automate the search for the optimal network structure of SNNs. Initially, we defined a differentiable two-level search space and conducted experiments within micro architecture under a fixed layer. Then, we incorporated a multi-dimensional attention mechanism and implemented the MA-DARTS algorithm in this search space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification compared to other methods under the same parameters with 94.40% accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset and 76.52% accuracy on CIFAR100 dataset. Additionally, we monitored and assessed the number of spikes (NoS) in each cell during the whole experiment. Notably, the number of spikes of the whole model stabilized at approximately 110K in validation and 100k in training on datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OStr-DARTS: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search based on Operation Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14433v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has emerged as a promising technique for effective neural architecture search, and it mainly contains two steps to find the high-performance architecture: First, the DARTS supernet that consists of mixed operations will be optimized via gradient descent. Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relax DARTS: Relaxing the Constraints of Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11652v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics is a secure and innovative identification method. Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $\alpha$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $\beta$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CCBR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Learning Rate Scheduling for Neural Architecture Search on Long-Tailed Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07028v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we attempt to address the challenge of applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms, specifically the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), to long-tailed datasets where class distribution is highly imbalanced. We observe that traditional re-sampling and re-weighting techniques, which are effective in standard classification tasks, lead to performance degradation when combined with DARTS. To mitigate this, we propose a novel adaptive learning rate scheduling strategy tailored for the architecture parameters of DARTS when integrated with the Bilateral Branch Network (BBN) for handling imbalanced datasets. Our approach dynamically adjusts the learning rate of the architecture parameters based on the training epoch, preventing the disruption of well-trained representations in the later stages of training. Additionally, we explore the impact of branch mixing factors on the algorithm's performance. Through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an artificially induced long-tailed distribution, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to using DARTS alone. And the experiment results suggest that re-sampling methods inherently harm the performance of the DARTS algorithm. Our findings highlight the importance of careful data augment when applying DNAS to imbalanced learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient NAS with FaDE on Hierarchical Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16218v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a challenging problem. Hierarchical search spaces allow for cheap evaluations of neural network sub modules to serve as surrogate for architecture evaluations. Yet, sometimes the hierarchy is too restrictive or the surrogate fails to generalize. We present FaDE which uses differentiable architecture search to obtain relative performance predictions on finite regions of a hierarchical NAS space. The relative nature of these ranks calls for a memory-less, batch-wise outer search algorithm for which we use an evolutionary algorithm with pseudo-gradient descent. FaDE is especially suited on deep hierarchical, respectively multi-cell search spaces, which it can explore by linear instead of exponential cost and therefore eliminates the need for a proxy search space. Our experiments show that firstly, FaDE-ranks on finite regions of the search space correlate with corresponding architecture performances and secondly, the ranks can empower a pseudo-gradient evolutionary search on the complete neural architecture search space.</p></details> |  |

| **[Masked Autoencoders Are Robust Neural Architecture Search Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12086v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) currently relies heavily on labeled data, which is both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS framework based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE) that eliminates the need for labeled data during the search process. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the robust discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method in the unsupervised paradigm by introducing a multi-scale decoder. Through extensive experiments conducted on various search spaces and datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, providing empirical evidence of its superiority over baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[emoDARTS: Joint Optimisation of CNN & Sequential Neural Network Architectures for Superior Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14083v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance. While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing on February 19, 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.14402</p></details> |
| **[PEFT for Speech: Unveiling Optimal Placement, Merging Strategies, and Ensemble Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02122v2)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is increasingly recognized as an effective method in speech processing. However, the optimal approach and the placement of PEFT methods remain inconclusive. Our study conducts extensive experiments to compare different PEFT methods and their layer-wise placement adapting Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). We also explore the use of ensemble learning to leverage diverse PEFT strategies. The results reveal that DARTS does not outperform the baseline approach, which involves inserting the same PEFT method into all layers of a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model. In contrast, an ensemble learning approach, particularly one employing majority voting, demonstrates superior performance. Our statistical evidence indicates that different PEFT methods learn in varied ways. This variation might explain why the synergistic integration of various PEFT methods through ensemble learning can harness their unique learning capabilities more effectively compared to individual layer-wise optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024 Self-supervision in Audio, Speech and Beyond (SASB) workshop</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14402v3)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical enabler of emotion-aware communication in human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have substantially enhanced the performance of SER models through increased model complexity. However, designing optimal DL architectures requires prior experience and experimental evaluations. Encouragingly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a promising avenue to determine an optimal DL model automatically. In particular, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient method of using NAS to search for optimised models. This paper proposes a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and LSTM architecture, to improve SER performance, where the literature informs the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to offer improved performance. While DARTS has previously been applied to CNN and LSTM combinations, our approach introduces a novel mechanism, particularly in selecting CNN operations using DARTS. In contrast to previous studies, we refrain from imposing constraints on the order of the layers for the CNN within the DARTS cell; instead, we allow DARTS to determine the optimal layer order autonomously. Experimenting with the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significantly higher SER accuracy than hand-engineering the CNN-LSTM configuration. It also outperforms the best-reported SER results achieved using DARTS on CNN-LSTM.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Efficient Architecture Search via Bi-level Data Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14200v1)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the efficiency of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a challenging but significant task that has received much attention. Previous works mainly adopted the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and improved its search strategies or modules to enhance search efficiency. Recently, some methods have started considering data reduction for speedup, but they are not tightly coupled with the architecture search process, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To this end, this work pioneers an exploration into the critical role of dataset characteristics for DARTS bi-level optimization, and then proposes a novel Bi-level Data Pruning (BDP) paradigm that targets the weights and architecture levels of DARTS to enhance efficiency from a data perspective. Specifically, we introduce a new progressive data pruning strategy that utilizes supernet prediction dynamics as the metric, to gradually prune unsuitable samples for DARTS during the search. An effective automatic class balance constraint is also integrated into BDP, to suppress potential class imbalances resulting from data-efficient algorithms. Comprehensive evaluations on the NAS-Bench-201 search space, DARTS search space, and MobileNet-like search space validate that BDP reduces search costs by over 50% while achieving superior performance when applied to baseline DARTS. Besides, we demonstrate that BDP can harmoniously integrate with advanced DARTS variants, like PC-DARTS and \b{eta}-DARTS, offering an approximately 2 times speedup with minimal performance compromises.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MGAS: Multi-Granularity Architecture Search for Trade-Off Between Model Effectiveness and Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15074v3)** | 2023-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has gained significant traction in automating the design of neural networks. To reduce the time cost, differentiable architecture search (DAS) transforms the traditional paradigm of discrete candidate sampling and evaluation into that of differentiable super-net optimization and discretization. However, existing DAS methods fail to trade off between model performance and model size. They either only conduct coarse-grained operation-level search, which results in redundant model parameters, or restrictively explore fine-grained filter-level and weight-level units with pre-defined remaining ratios, suffering from excessive pruning problem. Additionally, these methods compromise search quality to save memory during the search process. To tackle these issues, we introduce multi-granularity architecture search (MGAS), a unified framework which aims to discover both effective and efficient neural networks by comprehensively yet memory-efficiently exploring the multi-granularity search space. Specifically, we improve the existing DAS methods in two aspects. First, we balance the model unit numbers at different granularity levels with adaptive pruning. We learn discretization functions specific to each granularity level to adaptively determine the unit remaining ratio according to the evolving architecture. Second, we reduce the memory consumption without degrading the search quality using multi-stage search. We break down the super-net optimization and discretization into multiple sub-net stages, and perform progressive re-evaluation to allow for re-pruning and regrowing of previous units during subsequent stages, compensating for potential bias. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that MGAS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in achieving a better trade-off between model performance and model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Sparse neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06968v5)** | 2023-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices is hindered by the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing power. While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[ICDARTS: Improving the Stability and Performance of Cyclic DARTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00664v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces improvements to the stability and generalizability of Cyclic DARTS (CDARTS). CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells.

| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search via Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05629v2)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a simple yet efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method. During the search stage, DARTS trains a supernet by jointly optimizing architecture parameters and network parameters. During the evaluation stage, DARTS discretizes the supernet to derive the optimal architecture based on architecture parameters. However, recent research has shown that during the training process, the supernet tends to converge towards sharp minima rather than flat minima. This is evidenced by the higher sharpness of the loss landscape of the supernet, which ultimately leads to a performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. In this paper, we propose Self-Distillation Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (SD-DARTS) to alleviate the discretization gap. We utilize self-distillation to distill knowledge from previous steps of the supernet to guide its training in the current step, effectively reducing the sharpness of the supernet's loss and bridging the performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of voting teachers, where multiple previous supernets are selected as teachers, and their output probabilities are aggregated through voting to obtain the final teacher prediction. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the advantages of our novel self-distillation-based NAS method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[ROME: Robustifying Memory-Efficient NAS via Topology Disentanglement and Gradient Accumulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11233v2)** | 2023-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Albeit being a prevalent architecture searching approach, differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is largely hindered by its substantial memory cost since the entire supernet resides in the memory. This is where the single-path DARTS comes in, which only chooses a single-path submodel at each step. While being memory-friendly, it also comes with low computational costs. Nonetheless, we discover a critical issue of single-path DARTS that has not been primarily noticed. Namely, it also suffers from severe performance collapse since too many parameter-free operations like skip connections are derived, just like DARTS does. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called RObustifying Memory-Efficient NAS (ROME) to give a cure. First, we disentangle the topology search from the operation search to make searching and evaluation consistent. We then adopt Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to robustify the unwieldy bi-level optimization. We verify ROME extensively across 15 benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | ICCV2023 |
| **[TND-NAS: Towards Non-differentiable Objectives in Progressive Differentiable NAS Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03892v4)** | 2023-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search has gradually become the mainstream research topic in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for its high efficiency compared with the early NAS methods. Recent differentiable NAS also aims at further improving the search performance and reducing the GPU-memory consumption. However, these methods are no longer naturally capable of tackling the non-differentiable objectives, e.g., energy, resource-constrained efficiency, and other metrics, let alone the multi-objective search demands. Researches in the multi-objective NAS field target this but requires vast computational resources cause of the sole optimization of each candidate architecture. In light of this discrepancy, we propose the TND-NAS, which is with the merits of the high efficiency in differentiable NAS framework and the compatibility among non-differentiable metrics in Multi-objective NAS. Under the differentiable NAS framework, with the continuous relaxation of the search space, TND-NAS has the architecture parameters been optimized in discrete space, while resorting to the progressive search space shrinking by architecture parameters. Our representative experiment takes two objectives (Parameters, Accuracy) as an example, we achieve a series of high-performance compact architectures on CIFAR10 (1.09M/3.3%, 2.4M/2.95%, 9.57M/2.54%) and CIFAR100 (2.46M/18.3%, 5.46/16.73%, 12.88/15.20%) datasets. Favorably, compared with other multi-objective NAS methods, TND-NAS is less time-consuming (1.3 GPU-days on NVIDIA 1080Ti, 1/6 of that in NSGA-Net), and can be conveniently adapted to real-world NAS scenarios (resource-constrained, platform-specialized).</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Channel Dimensions for Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08021v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding optimal channel dimensions (i.e., the number of filters in DNN layers) is essential to design DNNs that perform well under computational resource constraints. Recent work in neural architecture search aims at automating the optimization of the DNN model implementation. However, existing neural architecture search methods for channel dimensions rely on fixed search spaces, which prevents achieving an efficient and fully automated solution. In this work, we propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search method with an efficient dynamic channel allocation algorithm to enable a flexible search space for channel dimensions. We show that the proposed framework is able to find DNN architectures that are equivalent to previous methods in task accuracy and inference latency for the CIFAR-10 dataset with an improvement of $1.3-1.7\times$ in GPU-hours and $1.5-1.7\times$ in the memory requirements during the architecture search stage. Moreover, the proposed frameworks do not require a well-engineered search space a priori, which is an important step towards fully automated design of DNN architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

DARTS then remaps the relaxed supernet back to the discrete space by one-off post-search pruning to obtain the final architecture (finalnet). Some emerging works argue that this remap is inherently prone to mismatch the network between training and evaluation which leads to performance discrepancy and even model collapse in extreme cases. We propose to close the gap between the relaxed supernet in training and the pruned finalnet in evaluation through utilizing small temperature to sparsify the continuous distribution in the training phase. To this end, we first formulate sparse-noisy softmax to get around gradient saturation. We then propose an exponential temperature schedule to better control the outbound distribution and elaborate an entropy-based adaptive scheme to finally achieve the enhancement. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficiency and efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for PAKDD 2023</p></details> |
| **[Connection Sensitivity Matters for Training-free DARTS: From Architecture-Level Scoring to Operation-Level Sensitivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11542v4)** | 2023-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed training-free NAS methods abandon the training phase and design various zero-cost proxies as scores to identify excellent architectures, arousing extreme computational efficiency for neural architecture search. In this paper, we raise an interesting problem: can we properly measure the operation importance in DARTS through a training-free way, with avoiding the parameter-intensive bias? We investigate this question through the lens of edge connectivity, and provide an affirmative answer by defining a connectivity concept, ZERo-cost Operation Sensitivity (ZEROS), to score the importance of candidate operations in DARTS at initialization. By devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable architecture search (FreeDARTS). Based on the theory of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we show the proposed connectivity score provably negatively correlated with the generalization bound of DARTS supernet after convergence under gradient descent training. In addition, we theoretically explain how ZEROS implicitly avoids parameter-intensive bias in selecting architectures, and empirically show the searched architectures by FreeDARTS are of comparable size. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of search spaces, and results have demonstrated that FreeDARTS is a reliable and efficient baseline for neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised version with more theoretical analysis</p></details> |

Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS.

| **[Is Differentiable Architecture Search truly a One-Shot Method?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05647v3)** | 2023-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DAS) is a widely researched tool for the discovery of novel architectures, due to its promising results for image classification. The main benefit of DAS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DAS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the success of DAS can be extended from image classification to signal reconstruction, in principle. However, our experiments also expose three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DAS-based methods in inverse problems: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is strongly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. While the results on image reconstruction confirm the potential of the DAS paradigm, they challenge the common understanding of DAS as a one-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Operation-level Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05632v1)** | 2023-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) is becoming more and more popular among Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods because of its high search efficiency and low compute cost. However, the stability of DARTS is very inferior, especially skip connections aggregation that leads to performance collapse. Though existing methods leverage Hessian eigenvalues to alleviate skip connections aggregation, they make DARTS unable to explore architectures with better performance. In the paper, we propose operation-level progressive differentiable neural architecture search (OPP-DARTS) to avoid skip connections aggregation and explore better architectures simultaneously. We first divide the search process into several stages during the search phase and increase candidate operations into the search space progressively at the beginning of each stage. It can effectively alleviate the unfair competition between operations during the search phase of DARTS by offsetting the inherent unfair advantage of the skip connection over other operations. Besides, to keep the competition between operations relatively fair and select the operation from the candidate operations set that makes training loss of the supernet largest. The experiment results indicate that our method is effective and efficient. Our method's performance on CIFAR-10 is superior to the architecture found by standard DARTS, and the transferability of our method also surpasses standard DARTS. We further demonstrate the robustness of our method on three simple search spaces, i.e., S2, S3, S4, and the results show us that our method is more robust than standard DARTS.

We view existing operation scoring functions as inexact proxies for accuracy, and we find that they perform poorly when analyzed empirically on NAS benchmarks. From this perspective, we introduce a novel \textit{perturbation-based zero-cost operation scoring} (Zero-Cost-PT) approach, which utilizes zero-cost proxies that were recently studied in multi-trial NAS but degrade significantly on larger search spaces, typical for differentiable NAS. We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on a number of NAS benchmarks and large search spaces, from NAS-Bench-201, NAS-Bench-1Shot1, NAS-Bench-Macro, to DARTS-like and MobileNet-like spaces, showing significant improvements in both search time and accuracy. On the ImageNet classification task on the DARTS search space, our approach improved accuracy compared to the best current training-free methods (TE-NAS) while being over 10$\times$ faster (total searching time 25 minutes on a single GPU), and observed significantly better transferability on architectures searched on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an accuracy increase of 1.8 pp. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zerocostptnas/zerocost_operation_score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2023</p></details> |
| **[$β$-DARTS++: Bi-level Regularization for Proxy-robust Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06393v1)** | 2023-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (i.e., $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $\beta$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665</p></details> |
| **[$α$ DARTS Once More: Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search by Masked Image Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10105v1)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $\alpha$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, through numerous ablation studies, we systematically verify that not only does DARTS correctly upweight operations during its supernet phrase, but also gradually improves resulting discrete cells up to 30x more efficiently than random search, suggesting DARTS is surprisingly an effective tool for improving architectures in RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at the first Automated Machine Learning Conference (AutoML-Conf) 2022.

It drastically reduces search cost by resorting to weight-sharing. However, it also dramatically reduces the search space, thus excluding potential promising architectures. In this article, we propose D-DARTS, a solution that addresses this problem by nesting neural networks at the cell level instead of using weight-sharing to produce more diversified and specialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we also present an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existing handcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch. This approach is accompanied by a novel metric that measures the distance between architectures inside our custom search space.

In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |

We note that DNNs must be executed under strictly hard performance constraints in real-world scenarios, for example, the runtime latency on autonomous vehicles. However, to obtain the architecture that meets the given performance constraint, previous hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search runs to manually tune the hyper-parameters by trial and error, and thus the total design cost increases proportionally. To resolve this, we introduce a lightweight hardware-aware differentiable NAS framework dubbed LightNAS, striving to find the required architecture that satisfies various performance constraints through a one-time search (i.e., \underline{\textit{you only search once}}).

However, artificial adjustment of the parameters can have a relatively obvious influence on the results. It is almost impossible to manually set the best set of parameters. Therefore this paper proposes a fully automated end-toend fake audio detection method. We first use wav2vec pre-trained model to obtain a high-level representation of the speech. Furthermore, for the network structure, we use a modified version of the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) named light-DARTS. It learns deep speech representations while automatically learning and optimizing complex neural structures consisting of convolutional operations and residual blocks. The experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our proposed system achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 1.08%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Architecture Search with Random Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08835v1)** | 2022-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has significantly promoted the development of NAS techniques because of its high search efficiency and effectiveness but suffers from performance collapse. In this paper, we make efforts to alleviate the performance collapse problem for DARTS from two aspects. First, we investigate the expressive power of the supernet in DARTS and then derive a new setup of DARTS paradigm with only training BatchNorm. Second, we theoretically find that random features dilute the auxiliary connection role of skip-connection in supernet optimization and enable search algorithm focus on fairer operation selection, thereby solving the performance collapse problem. We instantiate DARTS and PC-DARTS with random features to build an improved version for each named RF-DARTS and RF-PCDARTS respectively. Experimental results show that RF-DARTS obtains \textbf{94.36\%} test accuracy on CIFAR-10 (which is the nearest optimal result in NAS-Bench-201), and achieves the newest state-of-the-art top-1 test error of \textbf{24.0\%} on ImageNet when transferring from CIFAR-10. Moreover, RF-DARTS performs robustly across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN) and four search spaces (S1-S4). Besides, RF-PCDARTS achieves even better results on ImageNet, that is, \textbf{23.9\%} top-1 and \textbf{7.1\%} top-5 test error, surpassing representative methods like single-path, training-free, and partial-channel paradigms directly searched on ImageNet.</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[Efficient Joint-Dimensional Search with Solution Space Regularization for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05271v1)** | 2022-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a popular research topic in computer vision, and many efforts have been made on it with impressive results. In this paper, we intend to search an optimal network structure that can run in real-time for this problem. Towards this goal, we jointly search the depth, channel, dilation rate and feature spatial resolution, which results in a search space consisting of about 2.78*10^324 possible choices. To handle such a large search space, we leverage differential architecture search methods. However, the architecture parameters searched using existing differential methods need to be discretized, which causes the discretization gap between the architecture parameters found by the differential methods and their discretized version as the final solution for the architecture search. Hence, we relieve the problem of discretization gap from the innovative perspective of solution space regularization. Specifically, a novel Solution Space Regularization (SSR) loss is first proposed to effectively encourage the supernet to converge to its discrete one. Then, a new Hierarchical and Progressive Solution Space Shrinking method is presented to further achieve high efficiency of searching. In addition, we theoretically show that the optimization of SSR loss is equivalent to the L_0-norm regularization, which accounts for the improved search-evaluation gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed search scheme can efficiently find an optimal network structure that yields an extremely fast speed (175 FPS) of segmentation with a small model size (1 M) while maintaining comparable accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[RARTS: An Efficient First-Order Relaxed Architecture Search Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03901v2)** | 2022-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is an effective method for data-driven neural network design based on solving a bilevel optimization problem. Despite its success in many architecture search tasks, there are still some concerns about the accuracy of first-order DARTS and the efficiency of the second-order DARTS. In this paper, we formulate a single level alternative and a relaxed architecture search (RARTS) method that utilizes the whole dataset in architecture learning via both data and network splitting, without involving mixed second derivatives of the corresponding loss functions like DARTS. In our formulation of network splitting, two networks with different but related weights cooperate in search of a shared architecture. The advantage of RARTS over DARTS is justified by a convergence theorem and an analytically solvable model. Moreover, RARTS outperforms DARTS and its variants in accuracy and search efficiency, as shown in adequate experimental results. For the task of searching topological architecture, i.e., the edges and the operations, RARTS obtains a higher accuracy and 60\% reduction of computational cost than second-order DARTS on CIFAR-10. RARTS continues to out-perform DARTS upon transfer to ImageNet and is on par with recent variants of DARTS even though our innovation is purely on the training algorithm without modifying search space. For the task of searching width, i.e., the number of channels in convolutional layers, RARTS also outperforms the traditional network pruning benchmarks. Further experiments on the public architecture search benchmark like NATS-Bench also support the preeminence of RARTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley-NAS: Discovering Operation Contribution for Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09811v1)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a Shapley value based method to evaluate operation contribution (Shapley-NAS) for neural architecture search. Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) acquires the optimal architectures by optimizing the architecture parameters with gradient descent, which significantly reduces the search cost. However, the magnitude of architecture parameters updated by gradient descent fails to reveal the actual operation importance to the task performance and therefore harms the effectiveness of obtained architectures. By contrast, we propose to evaluate the direct influence of operations on validation accuracy. To deal with the complex relationships between supernet components, we leverage Shapley value to quantify their marginal contributions by considering all possible combinations. Specifically, we iteratively optimize the supernet weights and update the architecture parameters by evaluating operation contributions via Shapley value, so that the optimal architectures are derived by selecting the operations that contribute significantly to the tasks. Since the exact computation of Shapley value is NP-hard, the Monte-Carlo sampling based algorithm with early truncation is employed for efficient approximation, and the momentum update mechanism is adopted to alleviate fluctuation of the sampling process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and various search spaces show that our Shapley-NAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin with light search cost.

| **[Incremental Learning with Differentiable Architecture and Forgetting Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09875v1)** | 2022-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As progress is made on training machine learning models on incrementally expanding classification tasks (i.e., incremental learning), a next step is to translate this progress to industry expectations. One technique missing from incremental learning is automatic architecture design via Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we show that leveraging NAS for incremental learning results in strong performance gains for classification tasks. Specifically, we contribute the following: first, we create a strong baseline approach for incremental learning based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and state-of-the-art incremental learning strategies, outperforming many existing strategies trained with similar-sized popular architectures; second, we extend the idea of architecture search to regularize architecture forgetting, boosting performance past our proposed baseline. We evaluate our method on both RF signal and image classification tasks, and demonstrate we can achieve up to a 10% performance increase over state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, our contribution enables learning from continuous distributions on real-world application data for which the complexity of the data distribution is unknown, or the modality less explored (such as RF signal classification).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2022)</p></details> |
| **[Warm-starting DARTS using meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06355v1)** | 2022-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML). NAS has outperformed hand-designed networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task, leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked. Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search (DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better. Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average by 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyclic Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10724v4)** | 2022-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search, i.e., DARTS, has drawn great attention in neural architecture search. It tries to find the optimal architecture in a shallow search network and then measures its performance in a deep evaluation network. The independent optimization of the search and evaluation networks, however, leaves room for potential improvement by allowing interaction between the two networks. To address the problematic optimization issue, we propose new joint optimization objectives and a novel Cyclic Differentiable ARchiTecture Search framework, dubbed CDARTS. Considering the structure difference, CDARTS builds a cyclic feedback mechanism between the search and evaluation networks with introspective distillation. First, the search network generates an initial architecture for evaluation, and the weights of the evaluation network are optimized. Second, the architecture weights in the search network are further optimized by the label supervision in classification, as well as the regularization from the evaluation network through feature distillation. Repeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and evaluation networks and thus enables the evolution of the architecture to fit the final evaluation network. The experiments and analysis on CIFAR, ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art ones. Specifically, in the DARTS search space, we achieve 97.52% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. In the chain-structured search space, we achieve 78.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 1.1% higher than EfficientNet-B0.

| **[Scene-adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Sequential Recommendation via Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07173v2)** | 2022-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender systems (SRS) have become a research hotspot due to its power in modeling user dynamic interests and sequential behavioral patterns. To maximize model expressive ability, a default choice is to apply a larger and deeper network architecture, which, however, often brings high network latency when generating online recommendations. Naturally, we argue that compressing the heavy recommendation models into middle- or light- weight neural networks is of great importance for practical production systems. To realize such a goal, we propose AdaRec, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework which compresses knowledge of a teacher model into a student model adaptively according to its recommendation scene by using differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we introduce a target-oriented distillation loss to guide the structure search process for finding the student network architecture, and a cost-sensitive loss as constraints for model size, which achieves a superior trade-off between recommendation effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to realize many-to-many layer mapping during knowledge distillation, which enables each intermediate student layer to learn from other intermediate teacher layers adaptively. Extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive or better accuracy with notable inference speedup comparing to strong counterparts, while discovering diverse neural architectures for sequential recommender models under different recommendation scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MS-DARTS: Mean-Shift Based Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09996v4)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an effective continuous relaxation-based network architecture search (NAS) method with low search cost. It has attracted significant attentions in Auto-ML research and becomes one of the most useful paradigms in NAS. Although DARTS can produce superior efficiency over traditional NAS approaches with better control of complex parameters, oftentimes it suffers from stabilization issues in producing deteriorating architectures when discretizing the continuous architecture. We observed considerable loss of validity causing dramatic decline in performance at this final discretization step of DARTS. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Shift based DARTS (MS-DARTS) to improve stability based on sampling and perturbation. Our approach can improve bot the stability and accuracy of DARTS, by smoothing the loss landscape and sampling architecture parameters within a suitable bandwidth. We investigate the convergence of our mean-shift approach, together with the effects of bandwidth selection that affects stability and accuracy. Evaluations performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that MS-DARTS archives higher performance over other state-of-the-art NAS methods with reduced search cost.</p></details> | 14pages |
| **[$β$-DARTS: Beta-Decay Regularization for Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01665v2)** | 2022-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search~(NAS) has attracted increasingly more attention in recent years because of its capability to design deep neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they suffer from two main issues, the weak robustness to the performance collapse and the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures. To solve these two problems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from too large. Furthermore, we provide in-depth theoretical analysis on how it works and why it works. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 show that our proposed method can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. In addition, our search scheme shows an outstanding property of being less dependent on training time and data. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | CVPR2022 |
| **[Learning from Mistakes based on Class Weighting with Application to Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00275v2)** | 2022-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from mistakes is an effective learning approach widely used in human learning, where a learner pays greater focus on mistakes to circumvent them in the future to improve the overall learning outcomes. In this work, we aim to investigate how effectively we can leverage this exceptional learning ability to improve machine learning models. We propose a simple and effective multi-level optimization framework called learning from mistakes using class weighting (LFM-CW), inspired by mistake-driven learning to train better machine learning models. In this formulation, the primary objective is to train a model to perform effectively on target tasks by using a re-weighting technique. We learn the class weights by minimizing the validation loss of the model and re-train the model with the synthetic data from the image generator weighted by class-wise performance and real data. We apply our LFM-CW framework with differential architecture search methods on image classification datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where the results show that our proposed strategy achieves lower error rate than the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZARTS: On Zero-order Optimization for Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04743v2)** | 2022-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a popular one-shot paradigm for NAS due to its high efficiency. It introduces trainable architecture parameters to represent the importance of candidate operations and proposes first/second-order approximation to estimate their gradients, making it possible to solve NAS by gradient descent algorithm. However, our in-depth empirical results show that the approximation will often distort the loss landscape, leading to the biased objective to optimize and in turn inaccurate gradient estimation for architecture parameters. This work turns to zero-order optimization and proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without enforcing the above approximation. Specifically, three representative zero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which MGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed. Moreover, we explore the connections between RS/MGS and gradient descent algorithm and show that our ZARTS can be seen as a robust gradient-free counterpart to DARTS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and search spaces show the remarkable performance of our method. In particular, results on 12 benchmarks verify the outstanding robustness of ZARTS, where the performance of DARTS collapses due to its known instability issue. Also, we search on the search space of DARTS to compare with peer methods, and our discovered architecture achieves 97.54% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 75.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which are state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropNAS: Grouped Operation Dropout for Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11679v1)** | 2022-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown encouraging results in automating the architecture design. Recently, DARTS relaxes the search process with a differentiable formulation that leverages weight-sharing and SGD where all candidate operations are trained simultaneously. Our empirical results show that such procedure results in the co-adaption problem and Matthew Effect: operations with fewer parameters would be trained maturely earlier. This causes two problems: firstly, the operations with more parameters may never have the chance to express the desired function since those with less have already done the job; secondly, the system will punish those underperforming operations by lowering their architecture parameter, and they will get smaller loss gradients, which causes the Matthew Effect. In this paper, we systematically study these problems and propose a novel grouped operation dropout algorithm named DropNAS to fix the problems with DARTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DropNAS solves the above issues and achieves promising performance. Specifically, DropNAS achieves 2.26% test error on CIFAR-10, 16.39% on CIFAR-100 and 23.4% on ImageNet (with the same training hyperparameters as DARTS for a fair comparison). It is also observed that DropNAS is robust across variants of the DARTS search space. Code is available at https://github.com/wiljohnhong/DropNAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASFD: Automatic and Scalable Face Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10781v1)** | 2022-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with current multi-scale based detectors, Feature Aggregation and Enhancement (FAE) modules have shown superior performance gains for cutting-edge object detection. However, these hand-crafted FAE modules show inconsistent improvements on face detection, which is mainly due to the significant distribution difference between its training and applying corpus, COCO vs. WIDER Face. To tackle this problem, we essentially analyse the effect of data distribution, and consequently propose to search an effective FAE architecture, termed AutoFAE by a differentiable architecture search, which outperforms all existing FAE modules in face detection with a considerable margin. Upon the found AutoFAE and existing backbones, a supernet is further built and trained, which automatically obtains a family of detectors under the different complexity constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks, WIDER Face and FDDB, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance-efficiency trade-off for the proposed automatic and scalable face detector (ASFD) family. In particular, our strong ASFD-D6 outperforms the best competitor with AP 96.7/96.2/92.1 on WIDER Face test, and the lightweight ASFD-D0 costs about 3.1 ms, more than 320 FPS, on the V100 GPU with VGA-resolution images.</p></details> | ACM MM2021 |
| **[Differentiable Channel Sparsity Search via Weight Sharing within Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14714v2)** | 2022-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the differentiable channel sparsity search (DCSS) for convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional channel pruning algorithms which require users to manually set prune ratios for each convolutional layer, DCSS automatically searches the optimal combination of sparsities. Inspired by the differentiable architecture search (DARTS), we draw lessons from the continuous relaxation and leverage the gradient information to balance the computational cost and metrics. Since directly applying the scheme of DARTS causes shape mismatching and excessive memory consumption, we introduce a novel technique called weight sharing within filters. This technique elegantly eliminates the problem of shape mismatching with negligible additional resources. We conduct comprehensive experiments on not only image classification but also find-grained tasks including semantic segmentation and image super resolution to verify the effectiveness of DCSS. Compared with previous network pruning approaches, DCSS achieves state-of-the-art results for image classification. Experimental results of semantic segmentation and image super resolution indicate that task-specific search achieves better performance than transferring slim models, demonstrating the wide applicability and high efficiency of DCSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00171v1)** | 2021-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms like DARTS, the training set used to update model weight and the validation set used to update model architectures are sampled from the same data distribution. Thus, the uncommon features in the dataset fail to receive enough attention during training. In this paper, instead of introducing more complex NAS algorithms, we explore the idea that adding quality synthesized datasets into training can help the classification model identify its weakness and improve recognition accuracy. We introduce a training strategy called ``Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model(DASGM)." In DASGM, the training set is used to update the classification model weight, while a synthesized dataset is used to train its architecture. The generated images have different distributions from the training set, which can help the classification model learn better features to identify its weakness. We formulate DASGM into a multi-level optimization framework and develop an effective algorithm to solve it. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet have demonstrated the effectiveness of DASGM. Code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaLeNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search via the Bayesian Learning Rule](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13204v1)** | 2021-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has received massive attention in recent years, mainly because it significantly reduces the computational cost through weight sharing and continuous relaxation. However, more recent works find that existing differentiable NAS techniques struggle to outperform naive baselines, yielding deteriorative architectures as the search proceeds. Rather than directly optimizing the architecture parameters, this paper formulates the neural architecture search as a distribution learning problem through relaxing the architecture weights into Gaussian distributions. By leveraging the natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI), the architecture distribution can be easily optimized based on existing codebases without incurring more memory and computational consumption. We demonstrate how the differentiable NAS benefits from Bayesian principles, enhancing exploration and improving stability. The experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmark datasets confirm the significant improvements the proposed framework can make. In addition, instead of simply applying the argmax on the learned parameters, we further leverage the recently-proposed training-free proxies in NAS to select the optimal architecture from a group architectures drawn from the optimized distribution, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmarks. Our best architecture in the DARTS search space also obtains competitive test errors with 2.37\%, 15.72\%, and 24.2\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04324v3)** | 2021-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search is prevalent in the field of NAS because of its simplicity and efficiency, where two paradigms, multi-path algorithms and single-path methods, are dominated. Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is intuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path methods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the gap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these two paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable Architecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable Gumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path sub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple sub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the optimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and sub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to improve training. The proposed framework strikes a balance between flexible memory usage and searching quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on ImageNet and CIFAR10, where the searched models show a comparable performance as the most recent approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighborhood-Aware Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06369v2)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods often return an architecture with good search performance but generalizes poorly to the test setting. To achieve better generalization, we propose a novel neighborhood-aware NAS formulation to identify flat-minima architectures in the search space, with the assumption that flat minima generalize better than sharp minima. The phrase ``flat-minima architecture'' refers to architectures whose performance is stable under small perturbations in the architecture (e.g., replacing a convolution with a skip connection). Our formulation takes the ``flatness'' of an architecture into account by aggregating the performance over the neighborhood of this architecture. We demonstrate a principled way to apply our formulation to existing search algorithms, including sampling-based algorithms and gradient-based algorithms. To facilitate the application to gradient-based algorithms, we also propose a differentiable representation for the neighborhood of architectures. Based on our formulation, we propose neighborhood-aware random search (NA-RS) and neighborhood-aware differentiable architecture search (NA-DARTS). Notably, by simply augmenting DARTS with our formulation, NA-DARTS outperforms DARTS and achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.</p></details> | BMVC 2021 |

Not surprisingly, the manual design process becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior experience, enormous effort, intuition, and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile, neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism with early stopping to automate the network design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the objective of Siamese tracking networks during offline training. Besides, the proposed early stopping strategy avoids over-fitting and performance collapse problems leading to generalization improvement. The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over five commonly-used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

Architectures designed by NAS outperform or compete with the best manual network designs in terms of accuracy, size, memory footprint and FLOPs. That said, previous studies focus on developing NAS algorithms for clean high quality data, a restrictive and somewhat unrealistic assumption. In this paper, focusing on the differentiable NAS algorithms, we show that vanilla NAS algorithms suffer from a performance loss if class labels are noisy. To combat this issue, we make use of the principle of information bottleneck as a regularizer. This leads us to develop a noise injecting operation that is included during the learning process, preventing the network from learning from noisy samples. Our empirical evaluations show that the noise injecting operation does not degrade the performance of the NAS algorithm if the data is indeed clean. In contrast, if the data is noisy, the architecture learned by our algorithm comfortably outperforms algorithms specifically equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to learn in the presence of label noise. In contrast to many algorithms designed to work in the presence of noisy labels, prior knowledge about the properties of the noise and its characteristics are not required for our algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022</p></details> |

Due to its success, numerous variants analyzing and improving parts of the DARTS framework have recently been proposed. By considering the problem as a constrained bilevel optimization, we present and analyze DARTS-PRIME, a variant including improvements to architectural weight update scheduling and regularization towards discretization. We propose a dynamic schedule based on per-minibatch network information to make architecture updates more informed, as well as proximity regularization to promote well-separated discretization. Our results in multiple domains show that DARTS-PRIME improves both performance and reliability, comparable to state-of-the-art in differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noisy Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03566v3)** | 2021-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has now become one of the mainstream paradigms of neural architecture search. However, it largely suffers from the well-known performance collapse issue due to the aggregation of skip connections. It is thought to have overly benefited from the residual structure which accelerates the information flow. To weaken this impact, we propose to inject unbiased random noise to impede the flow. We name this novel approach NoisyDARTS. In effect, a network optimizer should perceive this difficulty at each training step and refrain from overshooting, especially on skip connections. In the long run, since we add no bias to the gradient in terms of expectation, it is still likely to converge to the right solution area. We also prove that the injected noise plays a role in smoothing the loss landscape, which makes the optimization easier. Our method features extreme simplicity and acts as a new strong baseline. We perform extensive experiments across various search spaces, datasets, and tasks, where we robustly achieve state-of-the-art results.

| **[Delve into the Performance Degradation of Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13466v1)** | 2021-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is widely considered to be easy to overfit the validation set which leads to performance degradation. We first employ a series of exploratory experiments to verify that neither high-strength architecture parameters regularization nor warmup training scheme can effectively solve this problem. Based on the insights from the experiments, we conjecture that the performance of DARTS does not depend on the well-trained supernet weights and argue that the architecture parameters should be trained by the gradients which are obtained in the early stage rather than the final stage of training. This argument is then verified by exchanging the learning rate schemes of weights and parameters. Experimental results show that the simple swap of the learning rates can effectively solve the degradation and achieve competitive performance. Further empirical evidence suggests that the degradation is not a simple problem of the validation set overfitting but exhibit some links between the degradation and the operation selection bias within bilevel optimization dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of this bias and propose to utilize this bias to achieve an operation-magnitude-based selective stop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at the CIKM 2021 conference</p></details> |

| **[iDARTS: Improving DARTS by Node Normalization and Decorrelation Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11014v1)** | 2021-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) uses a continuous relaxation of network representation and dramatically accelerates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by almost thousands of times in GPU-day. However, the searching process of DARTS is unstable, which suffers severe degradation when training epochs become large, thus limiting its application. In this paper, we claim that this degradation issue is caused by the imbalanced norms between different nodes and the highly correlated outputs from various operations. We then propose an improved version of DARTS, namely iDARTS, to deal with the two problems. In the training phase, it introduces node normalization to maintain the norm balance. In the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based on the similarity between the outputs of the node and the decorrelated operations rather than the values of the architecture parameters. Extensive evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and the error rates of 2.25\% and 24.7\% are reported within 0.2 and 1.9 GPU-day for architecture search respectively, which shows its effectiveness. Additional analysis also reveals that iDARTS has the advantage in robustness and generalization over other DARTS-based counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the architecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization, Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective method will give some insights on differential architecture search.

However, the network performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of predictions.</p></details> |  |

In ASR field especially end-to-end ASR, the related research is still in its infancy. In this work, we focus on applying NAS on the most popular manually designed model: Conformer, and then propose an efficient ASR model searching method that benefits from the natural advantage of differentiable architecture search (Darts) in reducing computational overheads. We fuse Darts mutator and Conformer blocks to form a complete search space, within which a modified architecture called Darts-Conformer cell is found automatically. The entire searching process on AISHELL-1 dataset costs only 0.7 GPU days. Replacing the Conformer encoder by stacking searched cell, we get an end-to-end ASR model (named as Darts-Conformner) that outperforms the Conformer baseline by 4.7\% on the open-source AISHELL-1 dataset. Besides, we verify the transferability of the architecture searched on a small dataset to a larger 2k-hour dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to apply gradient-based architecture search in the attention-based encoder-decoder ASR model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASRU 2021</p></details> |

The intrinsic problem complexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative networks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of network architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated architecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable search framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The searching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization problem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network architecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the discriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the inner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by alternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable manner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search space. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our algorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a single GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible configurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the searching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would benefit further research on architectures for generative models.

| **[iDARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search with Stochastic Implicit Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10784v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has recently become the mainstream of neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and simplicity. With a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path. To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming, with large margins, those learned by the baseline methods.</p></details> | ICML2021 |

It is extended from the existing study on differentiable neural architecture search, and we made the backbone architecture transformable rather than fixed during the training process. As is known, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) requires a pre-defined over-parameterized backbone architecture, while its size is to be determined manually. Also, in DARTS backbone, Hadamard product of two elements is not introduced, which exists in both LSTM and GRU cells for recurrent nets. This study introduces a growing mechanism for differentiable neural architecture search based on network morphism. It enables growing of the cell structures from small size towards large size ones with one-shot training. Two modes can be applied in integrating the growing and original pruning process. We also implement a recently proposed two-input backbone architecture for recurrent neural networks. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach and the two-input backbone structure can be quite effective compared with other baseline architectures including LSTM, in a variety of learning tasks including multi-variate time series forecasting and language modeling. On the other hand, we find that dynamic network transformation is promising in improving the efficiency of differentiable architecture search.</p></details> |  |

Pre-optimized ML models are connected and better performance is obtained by re-optimizing the connected one. The selection of an ML model from several small ML model candidates for each sub-task has been performed by using the idea based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and Single Path One-Shot NAS (SPOS-NAS) are tested, where the construction of loss functions is improved to keep all ML models smoothly learning. Using DARTS and SPOS-NAS as an optimization and selection as well as the connections for multi-step machine learning systems, we find that (1) such a system can quickly and successfully select highly performant model combinations, and (2) the selected models are consistent with baseline algorithms, such as grid search, and their outputs are well controlled.</p></details> |  |

However, directly using DARTS for Transformers is memory-intensive, which renders the search process infeasible. To this end, we propose a multi-split reversible network and combine it with DARTS. Specifically, we devise a backpropagation-with-reconstruction algorithm so that we only need to store the last layer's outputs. By relieving the memory burden for DARTS, it allows us to search with larger hidden size and more candidate operations. We evaluate the searched architecture on three sequence-to-sequence datasets, i.e., WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French, and WMT'14 English-Czech. Experimental results show that our network consistently outperforms standard Transformers across the tasks. Moreover, our method compares favorably with big-size Evolved Transformers, reducing search computation by an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2021</p></details> |

Yet, researchers are beginning to accumulate increasing amounts of data without having the temporal or monetary resources to integrate these data into scientific theories. We seek to overcome these limitations by incorporating existing machine learning techniques into an open-source pipeline for the automated construction of quantitative models. This pipeline leverages the use of neural architecture search to automate the discovery of interpretable model architectures, and automatic differentiation to automate the fitting of model parameters to data. We evaluate the utility of these methods based on their ability to recover quantitative models of human information processing from synthetic data. We find that these methods are capable of recovering basic quantitative motifs from models of psychophysics, learning and decision making. We also highlight weaknesses of this framework and discuss future directions for their mitigation.</p></details> |  |

In arrhythmia detection, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an important diagnostic technique. However, manually evaluating ECG signals is a complicated and time-consuming task. With the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the evaluation process has been accelerated and the performance is improved. It is noteworthy that the performance of CNNs heavily depends on their architecture design, which is a complex process grounded on expert experience and trial-and-error. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Heart-Darts, to efficiently classify the ECG signals by automatically designing the CNN model with the differentiable architecture search (i.e., Darts, a cell-based neural architecture search method). Specifically, we initially search a cell architecture by Darts and then customize a novel CNN model for ECG classification based on the obtained cells. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed method, we evaluate the constructed model on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Additionally, the extensibility of the proposed CNN model is validated on two other new databases. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art CNN models in ECG classification in terms of both performance and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalisable Omni-Scale Representations for Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06827v5)** | 2021-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective person re-identification (re-ID) model should learn feature representations that are both discriminative, for distinguishing similar-looking people, and generalisable, for deployment across datasets without any adaptation. In this paper, we develop novel CNN architectures to address both challenges. First, we present a re-ID CNN termed omni-scale network (OSNet) to learn features that not only capture different spatial scales but also encapsulate a synergistic combination of multiple scales, namely omni-scale features. The basic building block consists of multiple convolutional streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. For omni-scale feature learning, a unified aggregation gate is introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with channel-wise weights. OSNet is lightweight as its building blocks comprise factorised convolutions. Second, to improve generalisable feature learning, we introduce instance normalisation (IN) layers into OSNet to cope with cross-dataset discrepancies. Further, to determine the optimal placements of these IN layers in the architecture, we formulate an efficient differentiable architecture search algorithm. Extensive experiments show that, in the conventional same-dataset setting, OSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, despite being much smaller than existing re-ID models. In the more challenging yet practical cross-dataset setting, OSNet beats most recent unsupervised domain adaptation methods without using any target data.

NAS can be performed via policy gradient, evolutionary algorithms, differentiable architecture search or tree-search methods. While significant progress has been made for both policy gradient and differentiable architecture search, tree-search methods have so far failed to achieve comparable accuracy or search efficiency. In this paper, we formulate NAS as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) problem (CMAB-NAS). This allows the decomposition of a large search space into smaller blocks where tree-search methods can be applied more effectively and efficiently. We further leverage a tree-based method called Nested Monte-Carlo Search to tackle the CMAB-NAS problem. On CIFAR-10, our approach discovers a cell structure that achieves a low error rate that is comparable to the state-of-the-art, using only 0.58 GPU days, which is 20 times faster than current tree-search methods. Moreover, the discovered structure transfers well to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Making Differentiable Architecture Search less local](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10450v1)** | 2021-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a recent methodology for automating the design of neural network architectures. Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a promising NAS approach that dramatically increases search efficiency. However, it has been shown to suffer from performance collapse, where the search often leads to detrimental architectures. Many recent works try to address this issue of DARTS by identifying indicators for early stopping, regularising the search objective to reduce the dominance of some operations, or changing the parameterisation of the search problem. In this work, we hypothesise that performance collapses can arise from poor local optima around typical initial architectures and weights. We address this issue by developing a more global optimisation scheme that is able to better explore the space without changing the DARTS problem formulation. Our experiments show that our changes in the search algorithm allow the discovery of architectures with both better test performance and fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021 Workshop on Neural Architecture Search</p></details> |

NAS can derive a SOTA and data-specific architecture over validation data from a pre-defined search space with a search algorithm. Inspired by the success of NAS in ASR tasks, we propose a NAS-based ASR framework containing one search space and one differentiable search algorithm called Differentiable Architecture Search(DARTS). Our search space follows the convolution-augmented transformer(Conformer) backbone, which is a more expressive ASR architecture than those used in existing NAS-based ASR frameworks. To improve the performance of our method, a regulation method called Dynamic Search Schedule(DSS) is employed. On a widely used Mandarin benchmark AISHELL-1, our best-searched architecture outperforms the baseline Conform model significantly with about 11% CER relative improvement, and our method is proved to be pretty efficient by the search cost comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to INTERSPEECH 2021</p></details> |

However, these backbones may not be computationally efficient or the most suitable architectures for ReID. In this work, we aim to design a lightweight and suitable network for ReID. We propose a novel search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS), based on which we search for an efficient network architecture, which we call CDNet, via a differentiable architecture search algorithm. Through the use of the combined basic building blocks in CDS, CDNet tends to focus on combined pattern information that is typically found in images of pedestrians. We then propose a low-cost search strategy named the Top-k Sample Search strategy to make full use of the search space and avoid trapping in local optimal result. Furthermore, an effective Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck), which is removable at the inference time, is presented to balance the effects of triplet loss and softmax loss during the training process. Extensive experiments show that our CDNet (~1.8M parameters) has comparable performance with state-of-the-art lightweight networks.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2021 |
| **[DOTS: Decoupling Operation and Topology in Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00969v3)** | 2021-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted extensive attention due to its efficiency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Gradient for Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12529v1)** | 2021-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed for the automatic generation of task-oriented network architecture in image classification. However, the architectures obtained by existing NAS approaches are optimized only for classification performance and do not adapt to devices with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network architecture search algorithm aiming to simultaneously improve network performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and reduce network complexity. The proposed framework automatically builds the network architecture at two stages: block-level search and network-level search. At the stage of block-level search, a relaxation method based on the gradient is proposed, using an enhanced gradient to design high-performance and low-complexity blocks. At the stage of network-level search, we apply an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm to complete the automatic design from blocks to the target network. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms all evaluated hand-crafted networks in image classification, with an error rate of on CIFAR10 and an error rate of on CIFAR100, both at network parameter size less than one megabit. Moreover, compared with other neural architecture search methods, our method offers a tremendous reduction in designed network architecture parameters.</p></details> |  |

We treat the continuously relaxed architecture mixing weight as random variables, modeled by Dirichlet distribution. With recently developed pathwise derivatives, the Dirichlet parameters can be easily optimized with gradient-based optimizer in an end-to-end manner. This formulation improves the generalization ability and induces stochasticity that naturally encourages exploration in the search space. Furthermore, to alleviate the large memory consumption of differentiable NAS, we propose a simple yet effective progressive learning scheme that enables searching directly on large-scale tasks, eliminating the gap between search and evaluation phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we obtain a test error of 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 23.7% for ImageNet under the mobile setting.

It defines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which represents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the network and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method finds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a model with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the resulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a model with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization with the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion. Specifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS selects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M parameters within 0.3 GPU-days on CIFAR-10, and a top-1 error rate of 23.9% on ImageNet.

It is however challenging to design models that have both high accuracy and low latency for accurate and fast responsiveness. Many efforts have been made to develop end-to-end neural networks, in which depthwise separable convolutions, temporal convolutions, and LSTMs are adopted as building units. Nonetheless, these networks designed with human expertise may not achieve an optimal trade-off in an expansive search space. In this paper, we propose to leverage recent advances in differentiable neural architecture search to discover more efficient networks. Our searched model attains 97.2% top-1 accuracy on Google Speech Command Dataset v1 with only nearly 100K parameters.</p></details> | ICASSP 2021 |
| **[DARTS-: Robustly Stepping out of Performance Collapse Without Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01027v2)** | 2021-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the fast development of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), it suffers from long-standing performance instability, which extremely limits its application. Existing robustifying methods draw clues from the resulting deteriorated behavior instead of finding out its causing factor. Various indicators such as Hessian eigenvalues are proposed as a signal to stop searching before the performance collapses. However, these indicator-based methods tend to easily reject good architectures if the thresholds are inappropriately set, let alone the searching is intrinsically noisy. In this paper, we undertake a more subtle and direct approach to resolve the collapse. We first demonstrate that skip connections have a clear advantage over other candidate operations, where it can easily recover from a disadvantageous state and become dominant. We conjecture that this privilege is causing degenerated performance. Therefore, we propose to factor out this benefit with an auxiliary skip connection, ensuring a fairer competition for all operations. We call this approach DARTS-. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify that it can substantially improve robustness.

Based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture space, DARTS learns a differentiable architecture weight and largely reduces the search cost. However, its stability has been challenged for yielding deteriorating architectures as the search proceeds. We find that the precipitous validation loss landscape, which leads to a dramatic performance drop when distilling the final architecture, is an essential factor that causes instability. Based on this observation, we propose a perturbation-based regularization - SmoothDARTS (SDARTS), to smooth the loss landscape and improve the generalizability of DARTS-based methods. In particular, our new formulations stabilize DARTS-based methods by either random smoothing or adversarial attack. The search trajectory on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and due to the improved stability, we achieve performance gain across various search spaces on 4 datasets. Furthermore, we mathematically show that SDARTS implicitly regularizes the Hessian norm of the validation loss, which accounts for a smoother loss landscape and improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2020, code is available at https://github.com/xiangning-chen/SmoothDARTS</p></details> |

However, DAS-based methods mainly focus on searching for a repeatable cell structure, which is then stacked sequentially in multiple stages to form the networks. This configuration significantly reduces the search space, and ignores the importance of connections between the cells. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search (H-DAS) that performs architecture search both at the cell level and at the stage level. Specifically, the cell-level search space is relaxed so that the networks can learn stage-specific cell structures. For the stage-level search, we systematically study the architectures of stages, including the number of cells in each stage and the connections between the cells. Based on insightful observations, we design several search rules and losses, and mange to search for better stage-level architectures. Such hierarchical search space greatly improves the performance of the networks without introducing expensive search cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed H-DAS. Moreover, the searched stage-level architectures can be combined with the cell structures searched by existing DAS methods to further boost the performance.

Our search algorithm is inspired by the differential architecture search strategy and the Global Latent Optimization (GLO) procedure. This leads to both an efficient and stable GAN search. After the generator architecture is found, it can be plugged into any existing framework for GAN training.

The bias causes the architecture parameters of non-learnable operations to surpass that of learnable operations. Moreover, using softmax as architecture parameters' activation function and inappropriate learning rate would exacerbate the bias. As a result, it's frequently observed that non-learnable operations are dominated in the search phase. To reduce the bias, we propose to use single-level to replace bi-level optimization and non-competitive activation function like sigmoid to replace softmax. As a result, we could search high-performance architectures steadily. Experiments on NAS Benchmark 201 validate our hypothesis and stably find out nearly the optimal architecture. On DARTS space, we search the state-of-the-art architecture with 77.0% top1 accuracy (training setting follows PDARTS and without any additional module) on ImageNet-1K and steadily search architectures up-to 76.5% top1 accuracy (but not select the best from the searched architectures) which is comparable with current reported best result.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural Architecture Search for End-to-end Speech Recognition via Straight-Through Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05649v1)** | 2020-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS), the process of automating architecture engineering, is an appealing next step to advancing end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), replacing expert-designed networks with learned, task-specific architectures. In contrast to early computational-demanding NAS methods, recent gradient-based NAS methods, e.g., DARTS (Differentiable ARchiTecture Search), SNAS (Stochastic NAS) and ProxylessNAS, significantly improve the NAS efficiency. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we rigorously develop an efficient NAS method via Straight-Through (ST) gradients, called ST-NAS. Basically, ST-NAS uses the loss from SNAS but uses ST to back-propagate gradients through discrete variables to optimize the loss, which is not revealed in ProxylessNAS. Using ST gradients to support sub-graph sampling is a core element to achieve efficient NAS beyond DARTS and SNAS. Second, we successfully apply ST-NAS to end-to-end ASR. Experiments over the widely benchmarked 80-hour WSJ and 300-hour Switchboard datasets show that the ST-NAS induced architectures significantly outperform the human-designed architecture across the two datasets. Strengths of ST-NAS such as architecture transferability and low computation cost in memory and time are also reported.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE SLT 2021</p></details> |

Specifically, we encode a skeleton-based action instance into a tensor and carefully define a set of operations to build two types of network cells: normal cells and reduction cells. The recently developed DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) is adopted to search for an effective network architecture that is built upon the two types of cells. All operations are 2D based in order to reduce the overall computation and search space. Experiments on the challenging NTU RGB+D and Kinectics datasets have verified that most of the networks developed to date for skeleton-based action recognition are likely not compact and efficient. The proposed method provides an approach to search for such a compact network that is able to achieve comparative or even better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS+: Improved Differentiable Architecture Search with Early Stopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06035v2)** | 2020-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automating the process of neural architecture design, and the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method makes the process available within a few GPU days. However, the performance of DARTS is often observed to collapse when the number of search epochs becomes large. Meanwhile, lots of "{\em skip-connect}s" are found in the selected architectures. In this paper, we claim that the cause of the collapse is that there exists overfitting in the optimization of DARTS. Therefore, we propose a simple and effective algorithm, named "DARTS+", to avoid the collapse and improve the original DARTS, by "early stopping" the search procedure when meeting a certain criterion. We also conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and different search spaces and show the effectiveness of our DARTS+ algorithm, and DARTS+ achieves $2.32\%$ test error on CIFAR10, $14.87\%$ on CIFAR100, and $23.7\%$ on ImageNet. We further remark that the idea of "early stopping" is implicitly included in some existing DARTS variants by manually setting a small number of search epochs, while we give an {\em explicit} criterion for "early stopping".</p></details> |  |

While TinyML initially focused on enabling simple inference tasks on microcontrollers, the emergence of TinyDL marks a paradigm shift toward deploying deep learning models on severely resource-constrained hardware. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators. Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally, we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.</p></details> |  |

By utilizing an autoencoder that enforces an image similarity embedding in latent space, we construct an efficient kd-tree structure to order images by furthest neighbour dissimilarity in a low-dimensional embedding. From a given query image from our subsample dataset, we can identify the most dissimilar image within the global dataset in logarithmic time. Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of iterations required for convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 si...</summary><p>27 single-column pages, 8 figures, to be published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the implementations used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/IBM/analog-nas/tree/main/analognasbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

Lightweight data-agnostic neural architecture search without training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01306v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) enables the automatic design of neural network models. However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on either handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

A common goal in bilevel optimization is to minimize a hyper-objective that implicitly depends on the solution set of the lower-level function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely used, its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases where the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we first provide hardness results to show that the goal of finding stationary points of the hyper-objective for nonconvex-convex bilevel optimization can be intractable for zero-respecting algorithms. Then we study a class of tractable nonconvex-nonconvex bilevel problems when the lower-level function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We show a simple first-order algorithm can achieve better complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ in the deterministic, partially stochastic, and fully stochastic setting respectively. The complexities in the first two cases are optimal up to logarithmic factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in COLT 2024.

| **[Sequential Policy Gradient for Adaptive Hyperparameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15051v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

| **[One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Network Similarity Directed Initialization for Pathological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14176v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based pathological image analysis presents unique challenges due to the practical constraints of network design. Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARCO: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Conformal Prediction Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13755v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Optimal Kernel Size and Dimension in Convolutional Neural Networks An Architecture Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14846v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directed Acyclic Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12218v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters, 10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75% yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic within strict hardware limitations.</p></details> |  |

Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight 1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations (FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8, suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32 counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and 115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ISCC 2025</p></details> |

However, the usually large computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline is proposed.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the TaylorGLO method discovers novel, customized loss functions, resulting in improved performance, faster training, and improved data utilization. A likely reason is that such functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This paper demonstrates theoretically that this is indeed the case for TaylorGLO. Learning rule decomposition reveals that evolved loss functions balance two factors: the pull toward zero error, and a push away from it to avoid overfitting. This is a general principle that may be used to understand other regularization techniques as well (as demonstrated in this paper for label smoothing). The theoretical analysis leads to a constraint that can be utilized to find more effective loss functions in practice; the mechanism also results in networks that are more robust (as demonstrated in this paper with adversarial inputs). The analysis in this paper thus constitutes a first step towards understanding regularization, and demonstrates the power of evolutionary neural architecture search in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper appeared in CEC 2025; this paper includes appendices, expanded references, and corrections</p></details> |

The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.</p></details> |  |

QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, quantum architecture search, unsupervised representation learning</p></details> |

During past years, various ENAS methods have been proposed with exceptional performance. However, the theory research of ENAS is still in the infant. In this work, we step for the runtime analysis, which is an essential theory aspect of EAs, of ENAS upon multiclass classification problems. Specifically, we first propose a benchmark to lay the groundwork for the analysis. Furthermore, we design a two-level search space, making it suitable for multiclass classification problems and consistent with the common settings of ENAS. Based on both designs, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithms with one-bit and bit-wise mutations, and analyze their upper and lower bounds on the expected runtime. We prove that the algorithm using both mutations can find the optimum with the expected runtime upper bound of $O(rM\ln{rM})$ and lower bound of $\Omega(rM\ln{M})$. This suggests that a simple one-bit mutation may be greatly considered, given that most state-of-the-art ENAS methods are laboriously designed with the bit-wise mutation. Empirical studies also support our theoretical proof.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS, the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS. Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for predictor-based methods in the NAS community.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have been employed to automatically search for faster generation processes. However, NAS for diffusion is inherently time-consuming as it requires estimating thousands of diffusion models to search for the optimal one. In this paper, we introduce Flexiffusion, a novel training-free NAS paradigm designed to accelerate diffusion models by concurrently optimizing generation steps and network structures. Specifically, we partition the generation process into isometric step segments, each sequentially composed of a full step, multiple partial steps, and several null steps. The full step computes all network blocks, while the partial step involves part of the blocks, and the null step entails no computation. Flexiffusion autonomously explores flexible step combinations for each segment, substantially reducing search costs and enabling greater acceleration compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for diffusion models. Our searched models reported speedup factors of $2.6\times$ and $1.5\times$ for the original LDM-4-G and the SOTA, respectively. The factors for Stable Diffusion V1.5 and the SOTA are $5.1\times$ and $2.0\times$. We also verified the performance of Flexiffusion on multiple datasets, and positive experiment results indicate that Flexiffusion can effectively reduce redundancy in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks offer a very useful and popular solution that helps to democratize AI. However, these NAS frameworks are often computationally expensive to run, which limits their applicability and accessibility. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, capable of effectively transferring pretrained supernets based on Optimal Transport or multi-dataset pretaining. This method can be generally applied to NAS methods based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). Through extensive experiments across dozens of image classification tasks, we demonstrate that transferring pretrained supernets in this way can not only drastically speed up the supernet training which then finds optimal models (3 to 5 times faster on average), but even yield that outperform those found when running DARTS methods from scratch. We also observe positive transfer to almost all target datasets, making it very robust. Besides drastically improving the applicability of NAS methods, this also opens up new applications for continual learning and related fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexiffusion: Training-Free Segment-Wise Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02488v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was intended to be a v2 version of my previous paper (arXiv:2409.17566), but it was submitted as a new paper by mistake</p></details> |
| **[CARL: Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning for an Interpretable Performance Predictor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04001v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However, most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant (non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For instance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS.</p></details> |  |

When applied to machine learning tasks, VQAs give rise to NISQ-compatible Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), which have been shown to outperform classical neural networks with a similar number of trainable parameters. While the quantum circuit structures of VQAs for physics simulations are determined by the physical properties of the systems, identifying effective QNN architectures for general machine learning tasks is a difficult challenge due to the lack of domain-specific priors. Indeed, existing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms, adaptations of classical neural architecture search techniques, often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By approaching QAS from the ground-up and from a quantum perspective, we resolve this limitation by proposing $\rho$DARTS, a differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, emerging from the search space of quantum architectures. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization, Hamiltonian optimization, and image classification. Further, we demonstrate better convergence against existing QAS techniques and show improved robustness levels to noise.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures |

Traditional ANNs commonly use tree-like or DAG structures for simplicity, which can be preset or determined by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Yet, these structures restrict network collaboration and capability due to the absence of horizontal and backward communication. Biological neural systems, however, feature billions of neural units with highly complex connections, allowing each biological neuron to connect with others based on specific situations. Inspired by biological systems, we propose a novel framework that learns to construct arbitrary graph structures during training and introduce the concept of Neural Modules for organizing neural units, which facilitates communication between any nodes and collaboration among modules. Unlike traditional NAS methods that rely on DAG search spaces, our framework learns from complete graphs, enabling free communication between neurons akin to biological neural networks. Furthermore, we present a method to compute these structures and a regularization technique that organizes them into multiple independent, balanced neural modules. This approach reduces overfitting and improves efficiency through parallel computing. Overall, our method allows ANNs to learn effective arbitrary structures similar to biological ones. It is adaptable to various tasks and compatible across different scenarios, with experimental results demonstrating its potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2008.08261 by other authors</p></details> |

Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, Published on IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B) and Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B, two publicly available models derived from Llama-70B-Instruct. Both models achieve a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. These are the most accurate models supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |

This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Genet...</summary><p>Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO' 25)</p></details> |

Most existing graph BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However, the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, so called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and act as smart neural architecture search, Experiments demonstrated utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated so called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy and resource efficient deep learning training approach.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization (HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS).

Zero-shot NAS offers a training-free alternative by using proxies to predict architecture performance. However, existing proxies are often suboptimal -- frequently outperformed by simple metrics like parameter count or FLOPs -- and they generalize poorly across different search spaces. Moreover, current model-based proxies struggle to adapt to new operators without access to ground-truth accuracy, limiting their transferability. We propose TG-NAS, a universal, model-based zero-cost (ZC) proxy that combines a Transformer-based operator embedding generator with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict architecture performance. Unlike prior model-based predictors, TG-NAS requires no retraining and generalizes across arbitrary search spaces. It serves as a standalone ZC proxy with strong data efficiency, robustness, and cross-space consistency. Extensive evaluations across diverse NAS benchmarks demonstrate TG-NAS's superior rank correlation and generalizability compared to existing proxies. Additionally, it improves search efficiency by up to 300x and discovers architectures achieving 93.75% CIFAR-10 accuracy on NAS-Bench-201 and 74.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy on the DARTS space, establishing TG-NAS as a promising foundation for efficient, generalizable NAS.</p></details> |  |

However, reliable pose and depth perception remain fundamental challenges due to the transparent or low-contrast nature of the microrobots, as well as the noisy and dynamic conditions of the microscale environments in which they operate. An open dataset is crucial for enabling reproducible research, facilitating benchmarking, and accelerating the development of perception models tailored to microscale challenges. Standardised evaluation enables consistent comparison across algorithms, ensuring objective benchmarking and facilitating reproducible research. Here, we introduce the OpTical MicroRobot dataset (OTMR), the first publicly available dataset designed to support microrobot perception under the optical microscope. OTMR contains 232,881 images spanning 18 microrobot types and 176 distinct poses. We benchmarked the performance of eight deep learning models, including architectures derived via neural architecture search (NAS), on two key tasks: pose classification and depth regression. Results indicated that Vision Transformer (ViT) achieve the highest accuracy in pose classification, while depth regression benefits from deeper architectures.

The downside is increasingly large energy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space. Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while achieving the same level of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Starting training model from one dimension per feature field, DimGrow can progressively expand/shrink dimensions via importance scoring. Dimensions grow only when their importance consistently exceed a threshold, ensuring memory efficiency.

However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.</p></details> |  |

Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this process requires training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training, serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945 for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.</p></details> |  |

In contrast with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner, enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD, is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task. Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We address this issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex, which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally, in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain image classification tasks.

However, sonar images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity. Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a NAS search mechanism.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[Cognitive Neural Architecture Search Reveals Hierarchical Entailment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11141v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has suggested that the brain is more shallow than previously thought, challenging the traditionally assumed hierarchical structure of the ventral visual pathway. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing convolutional network architectures for brain-alignment via evolutionary neural architecture search results in models with clear representational hierarchies. Despite having random weights, the identified models achieve brain-alignment scores surpassing even those of pretrained classification models - as measured by both regression and representational similarity analysis. Furthermore, through traditional supervised training, architectures optimized for alignment with late ventral regions become competitive classification models. These findings suggest that hierarchical structure is a fundamental mechanism of primate visual processing. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of neural architecture search as a framework for computational cognitive neuroscience research that could reduce the field's reliance on manually designed convolutional networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta knowledge assisted Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21545v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary computation (EC)-based neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved remarkable performance in the automatic design of neural architectures. However, the high computational cost associated with evaluating searched architectures poses a challenge for these methods, and a fixed form of learning rate (LR) schedule means greater information loss on diverse searched architectures. This paper introduces an efficient EC-based NAS method to solve these problems via an innovative meta-learning framework. Specifically, a meta-learning-rate (Meta-LR) scheme is used through pretraining to obtain a suitable LR schedule, which guides the training process with lower information loss when evaluating each individual. An adaptive surrogate model is designed through an adaptive threshold to select the potential architectures in a few epochs and then evaluate the potential architectures with complete epochs. Additionally, a periodic mutation operator is proposed to increase the diversity of the population, which enhances the generalizability and robustness. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high performance comparable to that of many state-of-the-art peer methods, with lower computational cost and greater robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where multiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the objective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a powerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA leveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance on relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing computational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3, which integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown excellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a new memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The proposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local search-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with epistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead. Experiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving epistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as P3 and DSMGA-II.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE CEC 2025 (Poster)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting DL models to medical tasks remains a significant challenge, primarily due to two key factors: (1) architecture selection, as different tasks necessitate specialized model designs, and (2) weight initialization, which directly impacts the convergence speed and final performance of the models. Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely adopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial differences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network Search framework for medical imaging applications. MedNNS jointly optimizes architecture selection and weight initialization by constructing a meta-space that encodes datasets and models based on how well they perform together. We build this space using a Supernetwork-based approach, expanding the model zoo size by 51x times over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, we introduce rank loss and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) loss into the construction of the space to capture inter-model and inter-dataset relationships, thereby achieving more accurate alignment in the meta-space. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that MedNNS significantly outperforms both ImageNet pre-trained DL models and SOTA Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1.7% across datasets while converging substantially faster. The code and the processed meta-space is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MedNNS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16306v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</p></details> |  |

Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively. All three models surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MCUNet-in3/in4 (69.62% / 72.86%) and XiNet (72.27%), while maintaining a low computational cost of less than 100 million MACs and adhering to the stringent 320 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) constraint. These results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed framework for TinyML platforms, underscoring the potential of combining LLM-driven search, Pareto optimization, KD, and explainability to develop accurate, efficient, and interpretable models. This approach opens new possibilities in NAS, enabling the design of efficient architectures specifically suited for TinyML.</p></details> |  |

This paper, however, takes a different approach by introducing an energy-efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that directly focuses on identifying architectures that minimize energy consumption while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Unlike previous methods that primarily target vision and language tasks, the approach proposed here specifically addresses tabular datasets. Remarkably, the optimal architecture suggested by this method can reduce energy consumption by up to 92% compared to architectures recommended by conventional NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACIID...</summary><p>ACIIDS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

The ESP32 microcontroller, with 320 KB of memory, is used as the target platform. The artificial intelligence contribution lies in a novel method for optimizing convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit architectures by considering the memory size of the target microcontroller as a guide. A comparison is made between memory-driven model optimization and traditional two-stage methods, which use pruning, to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To demonstrate the engineering application of MicroNAS, a fall detection system (FDS) for lower-limb amputees is developed as a pilot study. A critical challenge in fall detection studies, class imbalance in the dataset, is addressed. The results show that MicroNAS models achieved higher F1-scores than alternative approaches, such as ensemble methods and H2O Automated Machine Learning, presenting a significant step forward in real-time FDS development. Biomechanists using body-worn sensors for activity detection can adopt the open-source code to design machine learning models tailored for microcontroller platforms with limited memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameter Optimization in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22854v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameters are configuration variables controlling the behavior of machine learning algorithms. They are ubiquitous in machine learning and artificial intelligence and the choice of their values determines the effectiveness of systems based on these technologies. Manual hyperparameter search is often unsatisfactory and becomes infeasible when the number of hyperparameters is large. Automating the search is an important step towards advancing, streamlining, and systematizing machine learning, freeing researchers and practitioners alike from the burden of finding a good set of hyperparameters by trial and error. In this survey, we present a unified treatment of hyperparameter optimization, providing the reader with examples, insights into the state-of-the-art, and numerous links to further reading. We cover the main families of techniques to automate hyperparameter search, often referred to as hyperparameter optimization or tuning, including random and quasi-random search, bandit-, model-, population-, and gradient-based approaches. We further discuss extensions, including online, constrained, and multi-objective formulations, touch upon connections with other fields such as meta-learning and neural architecture search, and conclude with open questions and future research directions.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Federated Neural Architecture Search with Model-Agnostic Meta Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06457v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) often struggles with data heterogeneity due to the naturally uneven distribution of user data across devices. Federated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enables collaborative search for optimal model architectures tailored to heterogeneous data to achieve higher accuracy. However, this process is time-consuming due to extensive search space and retraining. To overcome this, we introduce FedMetaNAS, a framework that integrates meta-learning with NAS within the FL context to expedite the architecture search by pruning the search space and eliminating the retraining stage. Our approach first utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization to facilitate relaxation of the mixed operations in the search space. We then refine the local search process by incorporating Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, where a task-specific learner adapts both weights and architecture parameters (alphas) for individual tasks, while a meta learner adjusts the overall model weights and alphas based on the gradient information from task learners. Following the meta-update, we propose soft pruning using the same trick on search space to gradually sparsify the architecture, ensuring that the performance of the chosen architecture remains robust after pruning which allows for immediate use of the model without retraining. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FedMetaNAS significantly accelerates the search process by more than 50\% with higher accuracy compared to FedNAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search: Two Constant Shared Weights Initialisations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04406v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last decade, zero-cost metrics have gained prominence in neural architecture search (NAS) due to their ability to evaluate architectures without training. These metrics are significantly faster and less computationally expensive than traditional NAS methods and provide insights into neural architectures' internal workings. This paper introduces epsinas, a novel zero-cost NAS metric that assesses architecture potential using two constant shared weight initialisations and the statistics of their outputs. We show that the dispersion of raw outputs, normalised by their average magnitude, strongly correlates with trained accuracy. This effect holds across image classification and language tasks on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and NAS-Bench-NLP. Our method requires no data labels, operates on a single minibatch, and eliminates the need for gradient computation, making it independent of training hyperparameters, loss metrics, and human annotations. It evaluates a network in a fraction of a GPU second and integrates seamlessly into existing NAS frameworks. The code supporting this study can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/egracheva/epsinas.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoRe Fine-Tuning with 10x Fewer Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17383v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have unlocked the potential to cheaply and easily specialize large pretrained models. However, the most prominent approaches, like low-rank adapters (LoRA), depend on heuristics or rules-of-thumb for their architectural choices -- potentially limiting their performance for new models and architectures. This limitation suggests that techniques from neural architecture search could be used to obtain optimal adapter architectures, but these are often expensive and difficult to implement. We address this challenge with Monarch Rectangular Fine-tuning (MoRe), a simple framework to search over adapter architectures that relies on the Monarch matrix class. Theoretically, we show that MoRe is more expressive than LoRA. Empirically, our approach is more parameter-efficient and performant than state-of-the-art PEFTs on a range of tasks and models, with as few as 5\% of LoRA's parameters.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate various AE architectures, including standard AEs, contractive AEs (CAEs), and discriminative AEs (DAEs), as well as a classifier-based discriminative AE (CDAE), optimized using the hyperparameter tuning tool Optuna. Bhattacharyya distance is selected from several metrics to assess class separability in the latent space, revealing challenges in distinguishing adjacent grades using unsupervised models. CDAE, integrating a supervised classifier branch, demonstrated superior performance in both latent space separation and classification accuracy. Given that CDAE-CNN achieved notable improvements in classification metrics, affirming the value of supervised learning for class-specific feature extraction, F1 score was incorporated into the tuning process to optimize classification performance. Results show significant improvements in identifying aggressive ccRCC grades by leveraging the classification capability of AE through latent clustering followed by fine-grained classification. Our model outperforms the current state of the art, CHR-Network, across all evaluated metrics. These findings suggest that integrating a classifier branch in AEs, combined with neural architecture search and contrastive learning, enhances grading automation in ccRCC pathology, particularly in detecting aggressive tumor grades, and may improve diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted 4-page paper at IEEE ISBI 2025. 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally relied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by incorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image classification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and crossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their decisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this study, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the architecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the KITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of YOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection accuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant performance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from 92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated machine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Task Neural Architecture Search Using Architecture Embedding and Transfer Rank](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00772v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task neural architecture search (NAS) enables transferring architectural knowledge among different tasks. However, ranking disorder between the source task and the target task degrades the architecture performance on the downstream task. We propose KTNAS, an evolutionary cross-task NAS algorithm, to enhance transfer efficiency. Our data-agnostic method converts neural architectures into graphs and uses architecture embedding vectors for the subsequent architecture performance prediction. The concept of transfer rank, an instance-based classifier, is introduced into KTNAS to address the performance degradation issue. We verify the search efficiency on NASBench-201 and transferability to various vision tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101. The scalability of our method is demonstrated on DARTs search space including CIFAR-10/100, MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST. Experimental results show that KTNAS outperforms peer multi-task NAS algorithms in search efficiency and downstream task performance. Ablation studies demonstrate the vital importance of transfer rank for transfer performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application to Electricity Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24019v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity demand forecasting is key to ensuring that supply meets demand lest the grid would blackout. Reliable short-term forecasts may be obtained by combining a Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with a State-Space model (Obst et al., 2021), leading to an adaptive (or online) model. A GAM is an over-parameterized linear model defined by a formula and a state-space model involves hyperparameters. Both the formula and adaptation parameters have to be fixed before model training and have a huge impact on the model's predictive performance. We propose optimizing them using the DRAGON package of Keisler (2025), originally designed for neural architecture search. This work generalizes it for automated online generalized additive model selection by defining an efficient modeling of the search space (namely, the space of the GAM formulae and adaptation parameters). Its application to short-term French electricity demand forecasting demonstrates the relevance of the approach</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

This measurement has enabled various mental health tracking and human-centric IoT applications. While on-device Socal Ambiance Measure (SAM) is highly desirable to ensure user privacy and thus facilitate wide adoption of the aforementioned applications, the required computational complexity of state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) powered SAM solutions stands at odds with the often constrained resources on mobile devices. Furthermore, only limited labeled data is available or practical when it comes to SAM under clinical settings due to various privacy constraints and the required human effort, further challenging the achievable accuracy of on-device SAM solutions. To this end, we propose a dedicated neural architecture search framework for Energy-efficient and Real-time SAM (ERSAM). Specifically, our ERSAM framework can automatically search for DNNs that push forward the achievable accuracy vs. hardware efficiency frontier of mobile SAM solutions. For example, ERSAM-delivered DNNs only consume 40 mW x 12 h energy and 0.05 seconds processing latency for a 5 seconds audio segment on a Pixel 3 phone, while only achieving an error rate of 14.3% on a social ambiance dataset generated by LibriSpeech. We can expect that our ERSAM framework can pave the way for ubiquitous on-device SAM solutions which are in growing demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP'23</p></details> |
| **[FBNetV5: Neural Architecture Search for Multiple Tasks in One Run](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10007v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design accurate and efficient image classification models. However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be "proxyless" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val. mAP with 1.2x fewer FLOPs as compared to YOLOX).</p></details> |  |
| **[Arch-LLM: Taming LLMs for Neural Architecture Generation via Unsupervised Discrete Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22063v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning has been widely explored across various modalities, including neural architectures, where it plays a key role in downstream applications like Neural Architecture Search (NAS). These methods typically learn an unsupervised representation space before generating/ sampling architectures for the downstream search. A common approach involves the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to map discrete architectures onto a continuous representation space, however, sampling from these spaces often leads to a high percentage of invalid or duplicate neural architectures. This could be due to the unnatural mapping of inherently discrete architectural space onto a continuous space, which emphasizes the need for a robust discrete representation of these architectures. To address this, we introduce a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to learn a discrete latent space more naturally aligned with the discrete neural architectures. In contrast to VAEs, VQ-VAEs (i) map each architecture into a discrete code sequence and (ii) allow the prior to be learned by any generative model rather than assuming a normal distribution. We then represent these architecture latent codes as numerical sequences and train a text-to-text model leveraging a Large Language Model to learn and generate sequences representing architectures. We experiment our method with Inception/ ResNet-like cell-based search spaces, namely NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201. Compared to VAE-based methods, our approach improves the generation of valid and unique architectures by over 80% on NASBench-101 and over 8% on NASBench-201. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method in NAS employing a sequence-modeling-based NAS algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[HW-NAS-Bench:Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10584v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. The codes and all collected data are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/HW-NAS-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2021 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

These modules contribute to a vast search space, resulting in searches that can take several GPU hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the search space. This makes joint optimization both challenging and computationally expensive. Furthermore, satisfying target device constraints across modules adds additional complexity to the optimization process. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FACETS}, e\textbf{\underline{F}}ficient Once-for-\textbf{\underline{A}}ll Object Detection via \textbf{\underline{C}}onstrained it\textbf{\underline{E}}ra\textbf{\underline{T}}ive\textbf{\underline{S}}earch, a novel unified iterative NAS method that refines the architecture of all modules in a cyclical manner. FACETS leverages feedback from previous iterations, alternating between fixing one module's architecture and optimizing the others. This approach reduces the overall search space while preserving interdependencies among modules and incorporates constraints based on the target device's computational budget. In a controlled comparison against progressive and single-module search strategies, FACETS achieves architectures with up to $4.75\%$ higher accuracy twice as fast as progressive search strategies in earlier stages, while still being able to achieve a global optimum. Moreover, FACETS demonstrates the ability to iteratively refine the search space, producing better performing architectures over time. The refined search space yields candidates with a mean accuracy up to $27\%$ higher than global search and $5\%$ higher than progressive search methods via random sampling.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Neural Architecture Search by Learning a Hierarchical Search Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21061v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful tool for many non-differentiable search related problems such as adversarial games. However, the performance of such approach highly depends on the order of the nodes that are considered at each branching of the tree. If the first branches cannot distinguish between promising and deceiving configurations for the final task, the efficiency of the search is exponentially reduced. In Neural Architecture Search (NAS), as only the final architecture matters, the visiting order of the branching can be optimized to improve learning. In this paper, we study the application of MCTS to NAS for image classification. We analyze several sampling methods and branching alternatives for MCTS and propose to learn the branching by hierarchical clustering of architectures based on their similarity. The similarity is measured by the pairwise distance of output vectors of architectures. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that MCTS, if provided with a good branching hierarchy, can yield promising solutions more efficiently than other approaches for NAS problems.</p></details> |  |

Yet, even with heavy-machinery approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), discovering effective connectivity patterns requires tremendous efforts due to either constrained connectivity design space or a sub-optimal exploration process induced by an unconstrained search space. In this paper, we propose CSCO, a novel paradigm that fabricates effective connectivity of convolutional operators with minimal utilization of existing design motifs and further utilizes the discovered wiring to construct high-performing ConvNets. CSCO guides the exploration via a neural predictor as a surrogate of the ground-truth performance. We introduce Graph Isomorphism as data augmentation to improve sample efficiency and propose a Metropolis-Hastings Evolutionary Search (MH-ES) to evade locally optimal architectures and advance search quality. Results on ImageNet show ~0.6% performance improvement over hand-crafted and NAS-crafted dense connectivity.

Existing zero-cost proxy methods, while reducing search overhead, demonstrate inadequate performance in architecture ranking tasks, particularly for Transformer-based models where they often underperform simple parameter counting metrics. Current automated proxy discovery approaches suffer from extended search times, susceptibility to data overfitting, and structural complexity. This paper introduces a novel zero-cost proxy methodology that quantifies model capacity through efficient weight statistics computation while decomposing Transformer architectures into functionally distinct sub-modules, thereby optimizing the balance of their contributions to overall performance. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of this approach, achieving a Spearman's rho of 0.76 and Kendall's tau of 0.53 on the FlexiBERT benchmark. The proposed method exhibits exceptional computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across diverse NAS benchmark tasks, offering a practical solution for large-scale architecture search.</p></details> |  |

We modify the commonly used "divide and conquer" framework in parallel computing by adding a correlation-based clustering step, transforming it into "clustering and conquer". This seemingly simple modification achieves the optimal sample complexity reduction for a widely used class of efficient large-scale R&S procedures. Our approach enjoys two key advantages: 1) it does not require highly accurate correlation estimation or precise clustering, and 2) it allows for seamless integration with various existing R&S procedures, while achieving optimal sample complexity. Theoretically, we develop a novel gradient analysis framework to analyze sample efficiency and guide the design of large-scale R&S procedures. We also introduce a new parallel clustering algorithm tailored for large-scale scenarios. Finally, in large-scale AI applications such as neural architecture search, our methods demonstrate superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instructing the Architecture Search for Spatial-temporal Sequence Forecasting with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17994v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications. Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[DataDAM: Efficient Dataset Distillation with Attention Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00093v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have long tried to minimize training costs in deep learning while maintaining strong generalization across diverse datasets. Emerging research on dataset distillation aims to reduce training costs by creating a small synthetic set that contains the information of a larger real dataset and ultimately achieves test accuracy equivalent to a model trained on the whole dataset. Unfortunately, the synthetic data generated by previous methods are not guaranteed to distribute and discriminate as well as the original training data, and they incur significant computational costs. Despite promising results, there still exists a significant performance gap between models trained on condensed synthetic sets and those trained on the whole dataset. In this paper, we address these challenges using efficient Dataset Distillation with Attention Matching (DataDAM), achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing training costs. Specifically, we learn synthetic images by matching the spatial attention maps of real and synthetic data generated by different layers within a family of randomly initialized neural networks. Our method outperforms the prior methods on several datasets, including CIFAR10/100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and subsets of ImageNet-1K across most of the settings, and achieves improvements of up to 6.5% and 4.1% on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-1K, respectively. We also show that our high-quality distilled images have practical benefits for downstream applications, such as continual learning and neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Conference in Computer Vision (ICCV) 2023</p></details> |
| **[ATOM: Attention Mixer for Efficient Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01373v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in dataset distillation seek to minimize training expenses by generating a condensed synthetic dataset that encapsulates the information present in a larger real dataset. These approaches ultimately aim to attain test accuracy levels akin to those achieved by models trained on the entirety of the original dataset. Previous studies in feature and distribution matching have achieved significant results without incurring the costs of bi-level optimization in the distillation process. Despite their convincing efficiency, many of these methods suffer from marginal downstream performance improvements, limited distillation of contextual information, and subpar cross-architecture generalization. To address these challenges in dataset distillation, we propose the ATtentiOn Mixer (ATOM) module to efficiently distill large datasets using a mixture of channel and spatial-wise attention in the feature matching process. Spatial-wise attention helps guide the learning process based on consistent localization of classes in their respective images, allowing for distillation from a broader receptive field. Meanwhile, channel-wise attention captures the contextual information associated with the class itself, thus making the synthetic image more informative for training. By integrating both types of attention, our ATOM module demonstrates superior performance across various computer vision datasets, including CIFAR10/100 and TinyImagenet. Notably, our method significantly improves performance in scenarios with a low number of images per class, thereby enhancing its potential. Furthermore, we maintain the improvement in cross-architectures and applications such as neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation in CVPR-DD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Offline Model-Based Optimization: Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17286v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline optimization is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering, where the goal is to optimize black-box functions using only offline datasets. This setting is particularly relevant when querying the objective function is prohibitively expensive or infeasible, with applications spanning protein engineering, material discovery, neural architecture search, and beyond. The main difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond the available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking), exploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious optimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the training distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have harnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop offline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully designed strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution issues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs. Despite its growing impact in accelerating scientific discovery, the field lacks a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we present the first thorough review of offline MBO. We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and multi-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate modeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in out-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores high-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs. Finally, we examine the key challenges and propose promising directions for advancement in this rapidly evolving field including safe control of superintelligent systems.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Explainable AI-Guided Efficient Approximate DNN Generation for Multi-Pod Systolic Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16583v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate deep neural networks (AxDNNs) are promising for enhancing energy efficiency in real-world devices. One of the key contributors behind this enhanced energy efficiency in AxDNNs is the use of approximate multipliers. Unfortunately, the simulation of approximate multipliers does not usually scale well on CPUs and GPUs. As a consequence, this slows down the overall simulation of AxDNNs aimed at identifying the appropriate approximate multipliers to achieve high energy efficiency with a minimum accuracy loss. To address this problem, we present a novel XAI-Gen methodology, which leverages the analytical model of the emerging hardware accelerator (e.g., Google TPU v4) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to precisely identify the non-critical layers for approximation and quickly discover the appropriate approximate multipliers for AxDNN layers. Our results show that XAI-Gen achieves up to 7x lower energy consumption with only 1-2% accuracy loss. We also showcase the effectiveness of the XAI-Gen approach through a neural architecture search (XAI-NAS) case study. Interestingly, XAI-NAS achieves 40\% higher energy efficiency with up to 5x less execution time when compared to the state-of-the-art NAS methods for generating AxDNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in the ISQED 2025 conference</p></details> |

Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compared the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN-based models, including VGG (Visual Geometry Group), Inception, ResNet (Residual Network), InceptionResNet, Xception (Extreme Inception), MobileNet, DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network), and NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network), for image classification tasks using the Fruit-360 dataset.</p></details> | 62 pages, 37 figures |

This paper introduces Neuvo Ecological Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a novel method that incorporates these evolutionary parameters directly into the candidate solutions' phenotypes, allowing them to evolve dynamically alongside architecture specifications. Experimental results across four binary classification datasets demonstrate that ENAS not only eliminates manual tuning of evolutionary parameters but also outperforms competitor NAS methodologies in convergence speed (reducing computational time by 18.3%) and accuracy (improving classification performance in 3 out of 4 datasets). By enabling "greedy individuals" to optimize resource allocation based on fitness, ENAS provides an efficient, self-regulating approach to neural architecture search.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Evaluating a Novel Neuroevolution and Neural Architecture Search System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10869v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of neural network features can have a large impact on both the accuracy and speed of the network. Despite the current industry shift towards large transformer models, specialized binary classifiers remain critical for numerous practical applications where computational efficiency and low latency are essential. Neural network features tend to be developed homogeneously, resulting in slower or less accurate networks when testing against multiple datasets. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of Neuvo NAS+ a novel Python implementation of an extended Neural Architecture Search (NAS+) which allows the user to optimise the training parameters of a network as well as the network's architecture. We provide an in-depth analysis of the importance of catering a network's architecture to each dataset. We also describe the design of the Neuvo NAS+ system that selects network features on a task-specific basis including network training hyper-parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size. Results show that the Neuvo NAS+ task-specific approach significantly outperforms several machine learning approaches such as Naive Bayes, C4.5, Support Vector Machine and a standard Artificial Neural Network for solving a range of binary classification problems in terms of accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate substantial diversity in evolved network architectures across different datasets, confirming the value of task-specific optimization. Additionally, Neuvo NAS+ outperforms other evolutionary algorithm optimisers in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, showing that properly optimized binary classifiers can match or exceed the performance of more complex models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, IEEE</p></details> |

The subnets are typically trained with a static training strategy (e.g., using the same learning rate (LR) scheduler and optimizer for all subnets). This, however, does not consider that individual subnets have distinct characteristics, leading to two problems: (1) The supernet training is biased towards the low-complexity subnets (unfairness); (2) the momentum update in the supernet is noisy (noisy momentum). We present a dynamic supernet training technique to address these problems by adjusting the training strategy adaptive to the subnets. Specifically, we introduce a complexity-aware LR scheduler (CaLR) that controls the decay ratio of LR adaptive to the complexities of subnets, which alleviates the unfairness problem. We also present a momentum separation technique (MS). It groups the subnets with similar structural characteristics and uses a separate momentum for each group, avoiding the noisy momentum problem. Our approach can be applicable to various N-shot NAS methods with marginal cost, while improving the search performance drastically. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on various search spaces (e.g., NAS-Bench-201, Mobilenet spaces) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of neural architecture spaces commonly used in differentiable NAS methods, specifically NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. By defining flatness metrics such as neighborhoods and loss barriers along paths in architecture space, we reveal locality and flatness characteristics analogous to the well-known properties of neural network loss landscapes in weight space. In particular, we find that highly accurate architectures cluster together in flat regions, while suboptimal architectures remain isolated, unveiling the detailed geometrical structure of the architecture search landscape. Building on these insights, we propose Architecture-Aware Minimization (A$^2$M), a novel analytically derived algorithmic framework that explicitly biases, for the first time, the gradient of differentiable NAS methods towards flat minima in architecture space. A$^2$M consistently improves generalization over state-of-the-art DARTS-based algorithms on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, across both NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces. Notably, A$^2$M is able to increase the test accuracy, on average across different differentiable NAS methods, by +3.60\% on CIFAR-10, +4.60\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.64\% on ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in practice. A$^2$M can be easily integrated into existing differentiable NAS frameworks, offering a versatile tool for future research and applications in automated machine learning.

| **[Behavior Importance-Aware Graph Neural Architecture Search for Cross-Domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07102v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) mitigates data sparsity and cold-start issues in recommendation systems. While recent CDR approaches using graph neural networks (GNNs) capture complex user-item interactions, they rely on manually designed architectures that are often suboptimal and labor-intensive. Additionally, extracting valuable behavioral information from source domains to improve target domain recommendations remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Behavior importance-aware Graph Neural Architecture Search (BiGNAS), a framework that jointly optimizes GNN architecture and data importance for CDR. BiGNAS introduces two key components: a Cross-Domain Customized Supernetwork and a Graph-Based Behavior Importance Perceptron. The supernetwork, as a one-shot, retrain-free module, automatically searches the optimal GNN architecture for each domain without the need for retraining. The perceptron uses auxiliary learning to dynamically assess the importance of source domain behaviors, thereby improving target domain recommendations. Extensive experiments on benchmark CDR datasets and a large-scale industry advertising dataset demonstrate that BiGNAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize GNN architecture and behavior data importance for cross-domain recommendation.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Oral |

| **[DART: An Automated End-to-End Object Detection Pipeline with Data Diversification, Open-Vocabulary Bounding Box Annotation, Pseudo-Label Review, and Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09174v4)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate real-time object detection is vital across numerous industrial applications, from safety monitoring to quality control. Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/chen-xin-94/DART.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected minor typos; no changes to results or conclusions</p></details> |

However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

| **[DART$^3$: Leveraging Distance for Test Time Adaptation in Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18337v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias, where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under (inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID, thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.</p></details> |  |

A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design, Contact Modeling, and Collision-inclusive Planning of a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT (DART)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18780v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collision-resilient quadrotors have gained significant attention given their potential for operating in cluttered environments and leveraging impacts to perform agile maneuvers. However, existing designs are typically single-mode: either safeguarded by propeller guards that prevent deformation or deformable but lacking rigidity, which is crucial for stable flight in open environments. This paper introduces DART, a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT, that adapts its post-collision response by either engaging a locking mechanism for a rigid mode or disengaging it for a flexible mode, respectively. Comprehensive characterization tests highlight the significant difference in post collision responses between its rigid and flexible modes, with the rigid mode offering seven times higher stiffness compared to the flexible mode. To understand and harness the collision dynamics, we propose a novel collision response prediction model based on the linear complementarity system theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of predicting collision forces for both the rigid and flexible modes of DART. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the model and underscore its potential to advance collision-inclusive trajectory planning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous approaches for radiology report generation have shown impressive performance. However, there remains significant potential to improve accuracy by ensuring that retrieved reports contain disease-relevant findings similar to those in the X-ray images and by refining generated reports. In this study, we propose a Disease-aware image-text Alignment and self-correcting Re-alignment for Trustworthy radiology report generation (DART) framework. In the first stage, we generate initial reports based on image-to-text retrieval with disease-matching, embedding both images and texts in a shared embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures the retrieval of reports with similar disease-relevant findings that closely align with the input X-ray images. In the second stage, we further enhance the initial reports by introducing a self-correction module that re-aligns them with the X-ray images. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, surpassing previous approaches in both report generation and clinical efficacy metrics, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of radiology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DART: An AIGT Detector using AMR of Rephrased Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11517v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) generate more human-like texts, concerns about the side effects of AI-generated texts (AIGT) have grown. So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing models focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the origin of AIGT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

They are trained by denoising a Markovian process which gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, conventional FL methods, particularly those following the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, utilize a central server for global aggregation, which exhibits limitations such as bottleneck and single point of failure. To address these issues, the Decentralized FL (DFL) paradigm has been proposed, which removes the client-server boundary and enables all participants to engage in model training and aggregation tasks. Nevertheless, as CFL, DFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably poisoning attacks that undermine model performance. While existing research on model robustness has predominantly focused on CFL, there is a noteworthy gap in understanding the model robustness of the DFL paradigm. In this paper, a thorough review of poisoning attacks targeting the model robustness in DFL systems, as well as their corresponding countermeasures, are presented. Additionally, a solution called DART is proposed to evaluate the robustness of DFL models, which is implemented and integrated into a DFL platform. Through extensive experiments, this paper compares the behavior of CFL and DFL under diverse poisoning attacks, pinpointing key factors affecting attack spread and effectiveness within the DFL. It also evaluates the performance of different defense mechanisms and investigates whether defense mechanisms designed for CFL are compatible with DFL. The empirical results provide insights into research challenges and suggest ways to improve the robustness of DFL models for future research.</p></details> |  |

We use this data-set to fit player skill models which can then be used in dynamic zero-sum games (ZSGs) that model real-world matches between players. We propose an empirical Bayesian approach based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) model that overcomes limitations in the data. Specifically we introduce two DM-based skill models where the first model borrows strength from other darts players and the second model borrows strength from other regions of the dartboard. We find these DM-based models outperform simpler benchmark models with respect to Brier and Spherical scores, both of which are proper scoring rules. We also show in ZSGs settings that the difference between DM-based skill models and the simpler benchmark models is practically significant.

Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter {\lambda} which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median {\lambda} in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with {\lambda} (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.</p></details> |  |

However, simulating realistic radar scans is a challenging task that requires an accurate model of the scene, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Rather than specifying these models explicitly, we propose DART - Doppler Aided Radar Tomography, a Neural Radiance Field-inspired method which uses radar-specific physics to create a reflectance and transmittance-based rendering pipeline for range-Doppler images. We then evaluate DART by constructing a custom data collection platform and collecting a novel radar dataset together with accurate position and instantaneous velocity measurements from lidar-based localization. In comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, DART synthesizes superior radar range-Doppler images from novel views across all datasets and additionally can be used to generate high quality tomographic images.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024; see https://wiselabcmu.github.io/dart/ for our project site</p></details> |
| **[DART: Depth-Enhanced Accurate and Real-Time Background Matting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15820v1)** | 2024-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matting with a static background, often referred to as ``Background Matting" (BGM), has garnered significant attention within the computer vision community due to its pivotal role in various practical applications like webcasting and photo editing. Nevertheless, achieving highly accurate background matting remains a formidable challenge, primarily owing to the limitations inherent in conventional RGB images. These limitations manifest in the form of susceptibility to varying lighting conditions and unforeseen shadows. In this paper, we leverage the rich depth information provided by the RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras to enhance background matting performance in real-time, dubbed DART. Firstly, we adapt the original RGB-based BGM algorithm to incorporate depth information. The resulting model's output undergoes refinement through Bayesian inference, incorporating a background depth prior. The posterior prediction is then translated into a "trimap," which is subsequently fed into a state-of-the-art matting algorithm to generate more precise alpha mattes. To ensure real-time matting capabilities, a critical requirement for many real-world applications, we distill the backbone of our model from a larger and more versatile BGM network. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Moreover, thanks to the distillation operation, our method achieves a remarkable processing speed of 33 frames per second (fps) on a mid-range edge-computing device. This high efficiency underscores DART's immense potential for deployment in mobile applications}</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: A Principled Approach to Adversarially Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11120v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts and adversarial examples are two major challenges for deploying machine learning models. While these challenges have been studied individually, their combination is an important topic that remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study the problem of adversarial robustness under a common setting of distribution shift - unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, given a labeled source domain $D_S$ and an unlabeled target domain $D_T$ with related but different distributions, the goal is to obtain an adversarially robust model for $D_T$. The absence of target domain labels poses a unique challenge, as conventional adversarial robustness defenses cannot be directly applied to $D_T$. To address this challenge, we first establish a generalization bound for the adversarial target loss, which consists of (i) terms related to the loss on the data, and (ii) a measure of worst-case domain divergence. Motivated by this bound, we develop a novel unified defense framework called Divergence Aware adveRsarial Training (DART), which can be used in conjunction with a variety of standard UDA methods; e.g., DANN [Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015]. DART is applicable to general threat models, including the popular $\ell_p$-norm model, and does not require heuristic regularizers or architectural changes. We also release DomainRobust: a testbed for evaluating robustness of UDA models to adversarial attacks. DomainRobust consists of 4 multi-domain benchmark datasets (with 46 source-target pairs) and 7 meta-algorithms with a total of 11 variants. Our large-scale experiments demonstrate that on average, DART significantly enhances model robustness on all benchmarks compared to the state of the art, while maintaining competitive standard accuracy. The relative improvement in robustness from DART reaches up to 29.2% on the source-target domain pairs considered.</p></details> |  |

Our goal was to design a small-scale car-like robot equipped with all the hardware needed for on-board navigation and control while keeping it cost-effective and easy to replicate. To develop DART, we built on an existing off-the-shelf model and augmented its sensor suite to improve its capabilities for control and motion planning tasks. We detail the hardware setup and the system identification challenges to derive the vehicle's models. Furthermore, we present some use cases where we used DART to test different motion planning applications to show the versatility of the platform. Finally, we provide a git repository with all the details to replicate DART, complete with a simulation environment and the data used for system identification.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[IS-DARTS: Stabilizing DARTS through Precise Measurement on Candidate Importance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12648v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among existing Neural Architecture Search methods, DARTS is known for its efficiency and simplicity. This approach applies continuous relaxation of network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However, performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness. To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2024, paper + supplementary, 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[ICDARTS: Improving the Stability and Performance of Cyclic DARTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00664v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces improvements to the stability and generalizability of Cyclic DARTS (CDARTS). CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>NOTE:...</summary><p>NOTE: This is an expanded version of a previously published conference paper.

| **[Word Sense Disambiguation as a Game of Neurosymbolic Darts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16663v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the hardest tasks in natural language understanding and knowledge engineering. The glass ceiling of 80% F1 score is recently achieved through supervised deep-learning, enriched by a variety of knowledge graphs. Here, we propose a novel neurosymbolic methodology that is able to push the F1 score above 90%. The core of our methodology is a neurosymbolic sense embedding, in terms of a configuration of nested balls in n-dimensional space. The centre point of a ball well-preserves word embedding, which partially fix the locations of balls. Inclusion relations among balls precisely encode symbolic hypernym relations among senses, and enable simple logic deduction among sense embeddings, which cannot be realised before. We trained a Transformer to learn the mapping from a contextualized word embedding to its sense ball embedding, just like playing the game of darts (a game of shooting darts into a dartboard). A series of experiments are conducted by utilizing pre-training n-ball embeddings, which have the coverage of around 70% training data and 75% testing data in the benchmark WSD corpus. The F1 scores in experiments range from 90.1% to 100.0% in all six groups of test data-sets (each group has 4 testing data with different sizes of n-ball embeddings). Our novel neurosymbolic methodology has the potential to break the ceiling of deep-learning approaches for WSD. Limitations and extensions of our current works are listed.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: Double Attention Reference-based Transformer for Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08837v1)** | 2023-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DARTS, a transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution. DARTS learns joint representations of two image distributions to enhance the content of low-resolution input images through matching correspondences learned from high-resolution reference images. Current state-of-the-art techniques in reference-based image super-resolution are based on a multi-network, multi-stage architecture. In this work, we adapt the double attention block from the GAN literature, processing the two visual streams separately and combining self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. Our work demonstrates how the attention mechanism can be adapted for the particular requirements of reference-based image super-resolution, significantly simplifying the architecture and training pipeline. We show that our transformer-based model performs competitively with state-of-the-art models, while maintaining a simpler overall architecture and training process. In particular, we obtain state-of-the-art on the SUN80 dataset, with a PSNR/SSIM of 29.83 / .809. These results show that attention alone is sufficient for the RSR task, without multiple purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustifying DARTS by Eliminating Information Bypass Leakage via Explicit Sparse Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06858v1)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a promising end to end NAS method which directly optimizes the architecture parameters through general gradient descent. However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

We observe some recent studies already suffer from this issue that overshadows the meaning of scores. In this work, we first propose and orchestrate a suite of improvements to frame a larger and harder DSS, termed LHD, while retaining high efficiency in search. We step forward to renovate a LHD-based new benchmark, taking care of both discernibility and accessibility. Specifically, we re-implement twelve baselines and evaluate them across twelve conditions by combining two underexpolored influential factors: transductive robustness and discretization policy, to reasonably construct a benchmark upon multi-condition evaluation. Considering that the tabular benchmarks are always insufficient to adequately evaluate the methods of neural architecture search (NAS), our work can serve as a crucial basis for the future progress of NAS. https://github.com/chaoji90/LHD</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Common training strategies to improve generalization involve the use of data augmentations, ensembling and model averaging. In this work, we first establish a surprisingly simple but strong benchmark for generalization which utilizes diverse augmentations within a training minibatch, and show that this can learn a more balanced distribution of features. Further, we propose Diversify-Aggregate-Repeat Training (DART) strategy that first trains diverse models using different augmentations (or domains) to explore the loss basin, and further Aggregates their weights to combine their expertise and obtain improved generalization. We find that Repeating the step of Aggregation throughout training improves the overall optimization trajectory and also ensures that the individual models have a sufficiently low loss barrier to obtain improved generalization on combining them. We shed light on our approach by casting it in the framework proposed by Shen et al. and theoretically show that it indeed generalizes better. In addition to improvements in In- Domain generalization, we demonstrate SOTA performance on the Domain Generalization benchmarks in the popular DomainBed framework as well. Our method is generic and can easily be integrated with several base training algorithms to achieve performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

In this paper, we raise an interesting problem: can we properly measure the operation importance in DARTS through a training-free way, with avoiding the parameter-intensive bias? We investigate this question through the lens of edge connectivity, and provide an affirmative answer by defining a connectivity concept, ZERo-cost Operation Sensitivity (ZEROS), to score the importance of candidate operations in DARTS at initialization. By devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable architecture search (FreeDARTS). Based on the theory of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we show the proposed connectivity score provably negatively correlated with the generalization bound of DARTS supernet after convergence under gradient descent training. In addition, we theoretically explain how ZEROS implicitly avoids parameter-intensive bias in selecting architectures, and empirically show the searched architectures by FreeDARTS are of comparable size. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of search spaces, and results have demonstrated that FreeDARTS is a reliable and efficient baseline for neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised version with more theoretical analysis</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Convolution for DARTS Search Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01286v3)** | 2023-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted considerable attention as a gradient-based neural architecture search method. Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS. Code is available from https://github.com/mahdihosseini/PIBConv.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[$α$ DARTS Once More: Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search by Masked Image Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10105v1)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $\alpha$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

Among different hand morphable models, MANO has been widely used in vision and graphics community. However, MANO disregards textures and accessories, which largely limits its power to synthesize photorealistic hand data. In this paper, we extend MANO with Diverse Accessories and Rich Textures, namely DART. DART is composed of 50 daily 3D accessories which varies in appearance and shape, and 325 hand-crafted 2D texture maps covers different kinds of blemishes or make-ups. Unity GUI is also provided to generate synthetic hand data with user-defined settings, e.g., pose, camera, background, lighting, textures, and accessories. Finally, we release DARTset, which contains large-scale (800K), high-fidelity synthetic hand images, paired with perfect-aligned 3D labels. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in diversity. As a complement to existing hand datasets, DARTset boosts the generalization in both hand pose estimation and mesh recovery tasks.

In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |

NAS has outperformed hand-designed networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task, leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked. Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search (DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better. Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average by 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stretchable Cells Help DARTS Search Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09300v2)** | 2022-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) has gained much success in discovering flexible and diverse cell types. To reduce the evaluation gap, the supernet is expected to have identical layers with the target network. However, even for this consistent search, the searched cells often suffer from poor performance, especially for the supernet with fewer layers, as current DARTS methods are prone to wide and shallow cells, and this topology collapse induces sub-optimal searched cells. In this paper, we alleviate this issue by endowing the cells with explicit stretchability, so the search can be directly implemented on our stretchable cells for both operation type and topology simultaneously. Concretely, we introduce a set of topological variables and a combinatorial probabilistic distribution to explicitly model the target topology. With more diverse and complex topologies, our method adapts well for various layer numbers. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that our stretchable cells obtain better performance with fewer layers and parameters. For example, our method can improve DARTS by 0.28\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset with 45\% parameters reduced or 2.9\% with similar FLOPs on ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  |

Solving the Game of Darts as a Dynamic Zero-Sum Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11031v2)** | 2022-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The game of darts has enjoyed great growth over the past decade with the perception of darts moving from that of a pub game to a game that is regularly scheduled on prime-time television in many countries including the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia among others. The game of darts involves strategic interactions between two players but to date the literature has ignored these interactions. In this paper, we formulate and solve the game of darts as a dynamic zero-sum-game (ZSG), and to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so. We also estimate individual skill models using a novel data-set based on darts matches that were played by the top 16 professional players in the world during the 2019 season. Using the fitted skill models and our ZSG problem formulation, we quantify the importance of playing strategically, i.e. taking into account the score and strategy of one's opponent, when computing an optimal strategy. For top professionals we find that playing strategically results in an increase in win-probability of just 0.2% - 0.6% over a single leg but as much as 2.3% over a best-of-35 legs match.</p></details> |  |

While modern weight-sharing NAS methods such as DARTS are able to finish the search in single-digit GPU days, extracting the final best architecture from the shared weights is notoriously unreliable. Training-Speed-Estimate (TSE), a recently developed generalization estimator with a Bayesian marginal likelihood interpretation, has previously been used in place of the validation loss for gradient-based optimization in DARTS. This prevents the DARTS skip connection collapse, which significantly improves performance on NASBench-201 and the original DARTS search space. We extend those results by applying various DARTS diagnostics and show several unusual behaviors arising from not using a validation set. Furthermore, our experiments yield concrete examples of the depth gap and topology selection in DARTS having a strongly negative impact on the search performance despite generally receiving limited attention in the literature compared to the operations selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 5th Workshop on Meta-Learning at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |
| **[iDARTS: Improving DARTS by Node Normalization and Decorrelation Discretization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11014v1)** | 2021-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) uses a continuous relaxation of network representation and dramatically accelerates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by almost thousands of times in GPU-day. However, the searching process of DARTS is unstable, which suffers severe degradation when training epochs become large, thus limiting its application. In this paper, we claim that this degradation issue is caused by the imbalanced norms between different nodes and the highly correlated outputs from various operations. We then propose an improved version of DARTS, namely iDARTS, to deal with the two problems. In the training phase, it introduces node normalization to maintain the norm balance. In the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based on the similarity between the outputs of the node and the decorrelated operations rather than the values of the architecture parameters. Extensive evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and the error rates of 2.25\% and 24.7\% are reported within 0.2 and 1.9 GPU-day for architecture search respectively, which shows its effectiveness. Additional analysis also reveals that iDARTS has the advantage in robustness and generalization over other DARTS-based counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probeable DARTS with Application to Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06859v1)** | 2021-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI technology has made remarkable achievements in computational pathology (CPath), especially with the help of deep neural networks. However, the network performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepDarts: Modeling Keypoints as Objects for Automatic Scorekeeping in Darts using a Single Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09880v1)** | 2021-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts. Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data (830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

Data-to-Text annotations can be a costly process, especially when dealing with tables which are the major source of structured data and contain nontrivial structures. To this end, we propose a procedure of extracting semantic triples from tables that encodes their structures by exploiting the semantic dependencies among table headers and the table title. Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and dialogue-act-based meaning representation tasks by utilizing techniques such as: tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion, and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing. We present systematic evaluation on DART as well as new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG 2017 to show that DART (1) poses new challenges to existing data-to-text datasets and (2) facilitates out-of-domain generalization.

By using a backend sequence-to-sequence model, our system iteratively analyzes the annotated labels in order to better sample unlabeled data.

The reward can be a non-linear function of the rewards of the selected individual arms. The direct use of a multi-armed bandit algorithm requires choosing among $\binom{N}{K}$ options, making the action space large. To simplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits {typically} assume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we prove the lower bound for top-$K$ subset selection with bandit feedback with possibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial setting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the reward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of individual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially finds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is computationally efficient and uses storage linear in $N$. Further, DART achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K\sqrt{KNT})$ for a time horizon $T$, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of $\sqrt{\log{2NT}}$. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization and maximizing the mean of individual rewards, the performance of the proposed algorithm surpasses that of state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that DART significantly outperforms existing methods for both linear and non-linear joint reward environments.</p></details> |  |

However, it suffers from well-known performance collapse due to an inevitable aggregation of skip connections. In this paper, we first disclose that its root cause lies in an unfair advantage in exclusive competition. Through experiments, we show that if either of two conditions is broken, the collapse disappears. Thereby, we present a novel approach called Fair DARTS where the exclusive competition is relaxed to be collaborative. Specifically, we let each operation's architectural weight be independent of others. Yet there is still an important issue of discretization discrepancy. We then propose a zero-one loss to push architectural weights towards zero or one, which approximates an expected multi-hot solution. Our experiments are performed on two mainstream search spaces, and we derive new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) is a computationally light method. To limit computational resources DARTS makes numerous approximations. These approximations result in inferior performance. We propose to fine-tune DARTS using fixed operations as they are independent of these approximations. Our method offers a good trade-off between the number of parameters and classification accuracy. Our approach improves the top-1 accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, CompCars, and MIO-TCD datasets by 0.56%, 0.50%, and 0.39%, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our approach performs better than DARTS, improving the accuracy by 0.28%, 1.64%, 0.34%, 4.5%, and 3.27% compared to DARTS, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, CompCars, and MIO-TCD datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Stabilizing DARTS with Amended Gradient Estimation on Architectural Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11831v5)** | 2020-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DARTS is a popular algorithm for neural architecture search (NAS). Despite its great advantage in search efficiency, DARTS often suffers weak stability, which reflects in the large variation among individual trials as well as the sensitivity to the hyper-parameters of the search process. This paper owes such instability to an optimization gap between the super-network and its sub-networks, namely, improving the validation accuracy of the super-network does not necessarily lead to a higher expectation on the performance of the sampled sub-networks. Then, we point out that the gap is due to the inaccurate estimation of the architectural gradients, based on which we propose an amended estimation method. Mathematically, our method guarantees a bounded error from the true gradients while the original estimation does not. Our approach bridges the gap from two aspects, namely, amending the estimation on the architectural gradients, and unifying the hyper-parameter settings in the search and re-training stages. Experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach largely improves search stability and, more importantly, enables DARTS-based approaches to explore much larger search spaces that have not been investigated before.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2020, updated experiments on Penn Treebank</p></details> |
| **[Progressive DARTS: Bridging the Optimization Gap for NAS in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10952v2)** | 2020-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of neural architecture search (NAS), researchers found powerful network architectures for a wide range of vision tasks. However, it remains unclear if the searched architecture can transfer across different types of tasks as manually designed ones did. This paper puts forward this problem, referred to as NAS in the wild, which explores the possibility of finding the optimal architecture in a proxy dataset and then deploying it to mostly unseen scenarios. We instantiate this setting using a currently popular algorithm named differentiable architecture search (DARTS), which often suffers unsatisfying performance while being transferred across different tasks. We argue that the accuracy drop originates from the formulation that uses a super-network for search but a sub-network for re-training. The different properties of these stages have resulted in a significant optimization gap, and consequently, the architectural parameters "over-fit" the super-network. To alleviate the gap, we present a progressive method that gradually increases the network depth during the search stage, which leads to the Progressive DARTS (P-DARTS) algorithm. With a reduced search cost (7 hours on a single GPU), P-DARTS achieves improved performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10) and a few target problems (ImageNet classification, COCO detection and three ReID benchmarks).

Targeting the full generality of the congestion problem, previous schemes rely on slow, iterative convergence to the appropriate sending rates (e.g., TIMELY takes 50 RTTs). Several papers have shown that even in oversubscribed datacenter networks most congestion occurs at the receiver. Accordingly, we propose a divide-and-specialize approach, called Dart, which isolates the common case of receiver congestion and further subdivides the remaining in-network congestion into the simpler spatially-localized and the harder spatially-dispersed cases. For receiver congestion, we propose direct apportioning of sending rates (DASR) in which a receiver for n senders directs each sender to cut its rate by a factor of n, converging in only one RTT. For the spatially-localized case, Dart provides fast (under one RTT) response by adding novel switch hardware for in-order flow deflection (IOFD) because RDMA disallows packet reordering on which previous load balancing schemes rely. For the uncommon spatially-dispersed case, Dart falls back to DCQCN. Small-scale testbed measurements and at-scale simulations, respectively, show that Dart achieves 60% (2.5x) and 79% (4.8x) lower 99th-percentile latency, and similar and 58% higher throughput than InfiniBand, and TIMELY and DCQCN.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

Despite the availability of open-source brain segmentation software, widespread clinical adoption of volumetric analysis has been hindered due to processing times and reliance on manual corrections. Here, we extend the use of deep learning models from proof-of-concept, as previously reported, to present a comprehensive segmentation of cortical and deep gray matter brain structures matching the standard regions of aseg+aparc included in the commonly used open-source tool, Freesurfer. The work presented here provides a real-life, rapid deep learning-based brain segmentation tool to enable clinical translation as well as research application of quantitative brain segmentation. The advantages of the presented tool include short (~1 minute) processing time and improved segmentation quality. This is the first study to perform quick and accurate segmentation of 102 brain regions based on the surface-based protocol (DMK protocol), widely used by experts in the field. This is also the first work to include an expert reader study to assess the quality of the segmentation obtained using a deep-learning-based model. We show the superior performance of our deep-learning-based models over the traditional segmentation tool, Freesurfer. We refer to the proposed deep learning-based tool as DARTS (DenseUnet-based Automatic Rapid Tool for brain Segmentation).

Key features of our system are: A deep neural network acoustic model that consists of a front end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by several layers of Time Delayed Neural Network (TDNN) and Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM); sequence discriminative training of the acoustic model; n-gram and recurrent neural network language model for decoding and N-best list rescoring. We show that a simple transfer learning method can achieve good results. The results are further improved by using unlabeled data from YouTube in a semi-supervised setup.

Aiming to solve an image classification task on a new domain that lacks labeled data but gains access to cheaply available unlabeled data, unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising technique to boost the performance without incurring extra labeling cost, by assuming images from different domains share some invariant characteristics. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method named Domain-Adversarial Residual-Transfer (DART) learning of Deep Neural Networks to tackle cross-domain image classification tasks. In contrast to the existing unsupervised domain adaption approaches, the proposed DART not only learns domain-invariant features via adversarial training, but also achieves robust domain-adaptive classification via a residual-transfer strategy, all in an end-to-end training framework. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method for cross-domain image classification tasks on several well-known benchmark data sets, in which our method clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

The DART descriptor is applied to four different problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching: (1) The DART features are directly employed as local descriptors in a bag-of-features classification framework and testing is carried out on four standard event-based object datasets (N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, CIFAR10-DVS, NCaltech-101). (2) Extending the classification system, tracking is demonstrated using two key novelties: (i) For overcoming the low-sample problem for the one-shot learning of a binary classifier, statistical bootstrapping is leveraged with online learning; (ii) To achieve tracker robustness, the scale and rotation equivariance property of the DART descriptors is exploited for the one-shot learning. (3) To solve the long-term object tracking problem, an object detector is designed using the principle of cluster majority voting. The detection scheme is then combined with the tracker to result in a high intersection-over-union score with augmented ground truth annotations on the publicly available event camera dataset. (4) Finally, the event context encoded by DART greatly simplifies the feature correspondence problem, especially for spatio-temporal slices far apart in time, which has not been explicitly tackled in the event-based vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, revision submitted to TPAMI in Nov 2018</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the implementations used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/IBM/analog-nas/tree/main/analognasbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot NAS via the Suppression of Local Entropy Decrease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06236v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B) and Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B, two publicly available models derived from Llama-70B-Instruct. Both models achieve a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. These are the most accurate models supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidelines for the Quality Assessment of Energy-Aware NAS Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15631v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is increasingly large energy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.</p></details> |  |

Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Such approximate approaches risk introducing estimation errors that may prove detrimental in risk-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose a two-stage HW-NAS framework, in which we first learn an architecture controller on a distribution of synthetic devices, and then directly deploy the controller on a target device. At test-time, our network controller deploys directly to the target device without relying on any pre-collected information, and only exploits direct interactions. In particular, the pre-training phase on synthetic devices enables the controller to design an architecture for the target device by interacting with it through a small number of high-fidelity latency measurements. To guarantee accessibility of our method, we only train our controller with training-free accuracy proxies, allowing us to scale the meta-training phase without incurring the overhead of full network training. We benchmark on HW-NATS-Bench, demonstrating that our method generalizes to unseen devices and searches for latency-efficient architectures by in-context adaptation using only a few real-world latency evaluations at test-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variation Matters: from Mitigating to Embracing Zero-Shot NAS Ranking Function Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19657v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful automatic alternative to manual design of a neural network. In the zero-shot version, a fast ranking function is used to compare architectures without training them. The outputs of the ranking functions often vary significantly due to different sources of randomness, including the evaluated architecture's weights' initialization or the batch of data used for calculations. A common approach to addressing the variation is to average a ranking function output over several evaluations. We propose taking into account the variation in a different manner, by viewing the ranking function output as a random variable representing a proxy performance metric. During the search process, we strive to construct a stochastic ordering of the performance metrics to determine the best architecture. Our experiments show that the proposed stochastic ordering can effectively boost performance of a search on standard benchmark search spaces.</p></details> |  |

We apply two methods, cluster analysis and anomaly detection models, to identify operational disruptions with geographical patterns in the NAS since 2010. We identify four types and twelve categories of days of operations, distinguished according to air traffic system operational performance and geographical patterns of disruptions. Two clusters--NAS Disruption and East Super Disruption, accounting for 0.8% and 1.2% of the days respectively, represent the most disrupted days of operations in U.S. air traffic system. Another 16.5% of days feature less severe but still significant disruptions focused on certain regions of the NAS, while on the remaining 81.5% of days the NAS operates relatively smoothly. Anomaly detection results show good agreement with cluster results and further distinguish days in the same cluster by severity of disruptions. Results show an increasing trend in frequency of disruptions especially post-COVID. Additionally, disruptions happen most frequently in the summer and winter.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 Figures, submitted to ATRDS</p></details> |

Rust is a performant low-level language that promises memory safety guarantees with its compiler, making it an attractive option for HPC application developers. We identified that the Rust ecosystem could benefit from more comprehensive scientific benchmark suites for standardizing comparisons and research. The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) is a standardized suite for evaluating various hardware aspects and is often used to compare different frameworks for parallelism. Therefore, our contributions are a Rust version of NPB, an analysis of the expressiveness and performance of the language features, and parallelization strategies. We compare our implementation with consolidated sequential and parallel versions of NPB. Experimental results show that Rust's sequential version is 1.23\% slower than Fortran and 5.59\% faster than C++, while Rust with Rayon was slower than both Fortran and C++ with OpenMP.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, the research introduces AHlam Na, a game-based mobile application designed to enhance adolescents' awareness and understanding of key health-related topics. Using a single-group pretest-posttest design, the study involved forty junior high school students from a randomly selected school in the Philippines. They interacted with the application that embedded adolescent health topics into its gameplay. Data collected through pretest and post-test surveys revealed a significant improvement in the student's knowledge and attitudes toward adolescent health after engaging in the game, indicating that game-based learning effectively enhances their learning experience. The positive reception and knowledge gains suggest that AHlam Na is a promising tool for promoting adolescent health awareness. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the application be integrated into the adolescent health curriculum in schools across the Philippines. Future studies should examine the long-term impact of game-based learning on health behaviors and expand the sample size to include more diverse demographic groups. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on game-based learning in health education by demonstrating the potential of digital games to address the limitations of traditional teaching methods. The successful implementation of AHlam Na underscores the importance of exploring gamified learning tools to deliver critical health information to young people effectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We assess the abilities of such reinforcement learning agents to transfer between different tasks. We perform our evaluation using the Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark, and consider the efficacy of the transferred agents, as well as how quickly they can be trained. We find that pretraining an agent on one task benefits the performance of the agent in another task in all but 1 task when considering final performance. We also show that the training procedure for an agent can be shortened significantly by pretraining it on another task. Our results indicate that these effects occur regardless of the source or target task, although they are more pronounced for some tasks than for others. Our results show that transfer learning can be an effective tool in mitigating the computational cost of the initial training procedure for reinforcement learning-based NAS agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, 13 Figures, Corrected data in Figure 5</p></details> |

Utilizing the newly constructed ROAD-Almaty dataset, which encompasses diverse weather, lighting, and traffic conditions, we evaluated the models' performance without any retraining. Quantitative analysis revealed that RT-DETR achieved an average F1-score of 0.672 at IoU=0.5, outperforming YOLOv8s (0.458) and YOLO-NAS (0.526) by approximately 46% and 27%, respectively. Additionally, all models exhibited significant performance declines at higher IoU thresholds (e.g., a drop of approximately 20% when increasing IoU from 0.5 to 0.75) and under challenging environmental conditions, such as heavy snowfall and low-light scenarios. These findings underscore the necessity for geographically diverse training datasets and the implementation of specialized domain adaptation techniques to enhance the reliability of autonomous vehicle detection systems globally. This research contributes to the understanding of domain generalization challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in underrepresented regions.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging domain-specific knowledge often requires automated tools to design and configure models effectively. In the case of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), researchers and practitioners usually resort to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches, which are resource- and time-intensive, requiring the training and evaluation of numerous candidate architectures. This raises sustainability concerns, particularly due to the high energy demands involved, creating a paradox: the pursuit of the most effective model can undermine sustainability goals. To mitigate this issue, zero-cost proxies have emerged as a promising alternative. These proxies estimate a model's performance without the need for full training, offering a more efficient approach. This paper addresses the challenges of model evaluation by automatically designing zero-cost proxies to assess DNNs efficiently. Our method begins with a randomly generated set of zero-cost proxies, which are evolved and tested using the NATS-Bench benchmark. We assess the proxies' effectiveness using both randomly sampled and stratified subsets of the search space, ensuring they can differentiate between low- and high-performing networks and enhance generalizability. Results show our method outperforms existing approaches on the stratified sampling strategy, achieving strong correlations with ground truth performance, including a Kendall correlation of 0.89 on CIFAR-10 and 0.77 on CIFAR-100 with NATS-Bench-SSS and a Kendall correlation of 0.78 on CIFAR-10 and 0.71 on CIFAR-100 with NATS-Bench-TSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Constructing and optimizing the performance of ML models continues to be a challenge. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) serves as a tool to aid in the construction and improvement of these models. Traditional NAS techniques struggle to perform well on routability prediction as a result of two primary factors. First, the separation between the training objective and the search objective adds noise to the NAS process. Secondly, the increased variance of the search objective further complicates performing NAS. We craft a novel NAS technique, coined SOAP-NAS, to address these challenges through novel data augmentation techniques and a novel combination of one-shot and predictor-based NAS. Results show that our technique outperforms existing solutions by 40% closer to the ideal performance measured by ROC-AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) in DRC hotspot detection. SOAPNet is able to achieve an ROC-AUC of 0.9802 and a query time of only 0.461 ms.</p></details> |  |

Different activation functions vary in speed and accuracy, ranging from faster but less accurate options like ReLU to slower but more accurate functions like SiLU or SELU. Typically, same activation function is used throughout an entire model architecture. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of using mixed activation functions in YOLO-based models, evaluating their impact on latency, memory usage, and accuracy across CPU, NPU, and GPU edge devices. We also propose a novel approach that leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design YOLO models with optimized mixed activation functions.The best model generated through this method demonstrates a slight improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to baseline model (SiLU), while it is 22.28% faster and consumes 64.15% less memory on the reference NPU device.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, FITML workshop, NeuRIPS 2024</p></details> |

Infinitely many, if we focus on the continuous aspect of the problem. A finite, possibly large number if we consider the discrete aspect, \emph{i.e.} on which surface which effectors are going to step and in what order. We introduce NAS, an algorithm that considers both aspects simultaneously and computes \emph{all} the possible solutions to such a contact planning problem, under standard assumptions. To our knowledge NAS is the first algorithm to produce a globally optimal policy, efficiently queried in real time for planning the next footsteps of a humanoid robot. Our empirical results (in simulation and on the Talos platform) demonstrate that, despite the theoretical exponential complexity, optimisations reduce the practical complexity of NAS to a manageable bilinear form, maintaining completeness guarantees and enabling efficient GPU parallelisation. NAS is demonstrated in a variety of scenarios for the Talos robot, both in simulation and on the hardware platform. Future work will focus on further reducing computation times and extending the algorithm's applicability beyond gaited locomotion.

However, existing research has primarily focused on hardware architecture and network co-design for large-scale neural networks, without considering resource constraints. In this study, we aim to develop edge-friendly deep neural networks (DNNs) for accelerators based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM). To achieve this, we propose an edge compilation and resource-constrained RRAM-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework to search for optimized neural networks meeting specific hardware constraints. Our compilation approach integrates layer partitioning, duplication, and network packing to maximize the utilization of computation units. The resulting network architecture can be optimized for either high accuracy or low latency using a one-shot neural network approach with Pareto optimality achieved through the Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The compilation of mobile-friendly networks, like Squeezenet and MobilenetV3 small can achieve over 80% of utilization and over 6x speedup compared to ISAAC-like framework with different crossbar resources. The resulting model from NAS optimized for speed achieved 5x-30x speedup.

This condition has caused significant economic losses as high as $200 million annually, and the root cause of WB has yet to be identified. Human palpation is the most common method of distinguishing a WB from others. However, this method is time-consuming and subjective. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning algorithms can evaluate the WB conditions of fillets in a non-invasive, objective, and high-throughput manner. In this study, 250 raw chicken breast fillet samples (normal, mild, severe) were taken, and spatially heterogeneous hardness distribution was first considered when designing HSI processing models. The study not only classified the WB levels from HSI but also built a regression model to correlate the spectral information with sample hardness data. To achieve a satisfactory classification and regression model, a neural network architecture search (NAS) enabled a wide-deep neural network model named NAS-WD, which was developed. In NAS-WD, NAS was first used to automatically optimize the network architecture and hyperparameters. The classification results show that NAS-WD can classify the three WB levels with an overall accuracy of 95%, outperforming the traditional machine learning model, and the regression correlation between the spectral data and hardness was 0.75, which performs significantly better than traditional regression models.</p></details> |  |

Extending BO into the multi-fidelity setting has been an emerging research topic, but faces the challenge of determining an appropriate fidelity for each hyperparameter configuration to fit the surrogate model. To tackle the challenge, we propose a multi-fidelity BO method named FastBO, which adaptively decides the fidelity for each configuration and efficiently offers strong performance. The advantages are achieved based on the novel concepts of efficient point and saturation point for each configuration.We also show that our adaptive fidelity identification strategy provides a way to extend any single-fidelity method to the multi-fidelity setting, highlighting its generality and applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 18th European Conference on Computer Vision ECCV 2024 Women in Computer Vision Workshop</p></details> |

This combination enables real-time detection of small objects crucial for assisting the blind in navigating indoor environments, such as furniture, appliances, and household items. Proposed method emphasizes low latency and high accuracy, enabling timely and informative voice-based guidance to enhance the user's spatial awareness and interaction with their surroundings.

| **[HCS-TNAS: Hybrid Constraint-driven Semi-supervised Transformer-NAS for Ultrasound Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04203v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise ultrasound segmentation is vital for clinicians to provide comprehensive diagnoses. However, developing a model that accurately segments ultrasound images is challenging due to the images' low quality and the scarcity of extensive labeled data. This results in two main solutions: (1) optimizing multi-scale feature representations, and (2) increasing resistance to data dependency. The first approach necessitates an advanced network architecture, but a handcrafted network is knowledge-intensive and often yields limited improvement. In contrast, neural architecture search (NAS) can more easily attain optimal performance, albeit with significant computational costs. Regarding the second issue, semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an established method, but combining it with complex NAS faces the risk of overfitting to a few labeled samples without extra constraints. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid constraint-driven semi-supervised Transformer-NAS (HCS-TNAS), balancing both solutions for segmentation. HCS-TNAS includes an Efficient NAS-ViT module for multi-scale token search before ViT's attention calculation, effectively capturing contextual and local information with lower computational costs, and a hybrid SSL framework that adds network independence and contrastive learning to the optimization for solving data dependency. By further developing a stage-wise optimization strategy, a rational network structure is identified. Experiments on public datasets show that HCS-TNAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, pushing the limit of ultrasound segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoNAS: Boosting Search Efficiency of Gradient-based NAS via Topological Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01311v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving search efficiency serves as one of the crucial objectives of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, many current approaches ignore the universality of the search strategy and fail to reduce the computational redundancy during the search process, especially in one-shot NAS architectures. Besides, current NAS methods show invalid reparameterization in non-linear search space, leading to poor efficiency in common search spaces like DARTS. In this paper, we propose TopoNAS, a model-agnostic approach for gradient-based one-shot NAS that significantly reduces searching time and memory usage by topological simplification of searchable paths. Firstly, we model the non-linearity in search spaces to reveal the parameterization difficulties. To improve the search efficiency, we present a topological simplification method and iteratively apply module-sharing strategies to simplify the topological structure of searchable paths. In addition, a kernel normalization technique is also proposed to preserve the search accuracy. Experimental results on the NASBench201 benchmark with various search spaces demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It proves the proposed TopoNAS enhances the performance of various architectures in terms of search efficiency while maintaining a high level of accuracy.

Recent studies show that existing training-free metrics have several limitations, such as limited correlation and poor generalisation across different search spaces and tasks. Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT. When integrated with an evolutionary algorithm for NAS, our SWAP-NAS achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in approximately 6 minutes and 9 minutes of GPU time respectively.</p></details> | ICLR2024 Spotlight |
| **[An Efficient NAS-based Approach for Handling Imbalanced Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16972v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class imbalance is a common issue in real-world data distributions, negatively impacting the training of accurate classifiers. Traditional approaches to mitigate this problem fall into three main categories: class re-balancing, information transfer, and representation learning. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance performance on long-tailed datasets by optimizing the backbone architecture through neural architecture search (NAS). Our research shows that an architecture's accuracy on a balanced dataset does not reliably predict its performance on imbalanced datasets. This necessitates a complete NAS run on long-tailed datasets, which can be computationally expensive. To address this computational challenge, we focus on existing work, called IMB-NAS, which proposes efficiently adapting a NAS super-network trained on a balanced source dataset to an imbalanced target dataset. A detailed description of the fundamental techniques for IMB-NAS is provided in this paper, including NAS and architecture transfer. Among various adaptation strategies, we find that the most effective approach is to retrain the linear classification head with reweighted loss while keeping the backbone NAS super-network trained on the balanced source dataset frozen. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments on the imbalanced CIFAR dataset for performance evaluation. Our conclusions are the same as those proposed in the IMB-NAS paper.</p></details> | 7 pages,3 figures |

NAS benchmarks aim to simulate runs of NAS experiments at zero cost, remediating the need for extensive compute. However, existing NAS benchmarks use synthetic datasets and model proxies that make simplified assumptions about the characteristics of these datasets and models, leading to unrealistic evaluations. We present a technique that allows searching for training proxies that reduce the cost of benchmark construction by significant margins, making it possible to construct realistic NAS benchmarks for large-scale datasets. Using this technique, we construct an open-source bi-objective NAS benchmark for the ImageNet2012 dataset combined with the on-device performance of accelerators, including GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs. Through extensive experimentation with various NAS optimizers and hardware platforms, we show that the benchmark is accurate and allows searching for state-of-the-art hardware-aware models at zero cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Design Automation Conference DAC'24</p></details> |

Yet, such references have remained elusive, as existing architectures fail to reach a low temperature coefficient (TC) while minimizing silicon area. In this work, we propose a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) peaking current reference, in which a resistor is biased by the threshold voltage difference between two transistors in weak inversion. This bias voltage is lower than in conventional architectures to cut down the silicon area occupied by the resistor and is obtained by forward body biasing one of the two transistors with an ultra-low-power voltage reference so as to reduce its threshold voltage. In addition, the proposed reference includes a circuit to suppress the leakage of parasitic diodes at high temperature, and two simple trimming mechanisms for the reference current and its TC. As the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been validated in both 0.11-$\mu$m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator, to demonstrate feasibility across different technology types. In post-layout simulation, the 0.11-$\mu$m design generates a 5-nA current with a 65-ppm/{\deg}C TC and a 2.84-%/V line sensitivity (LS), while in measurement, the 22-nm design achieves a 1.5-nA current with an 89-ppm/{\deg}C TC and a 0.51-%/V LS. As a result of the low resistor bias voltage, the proposed references occupy a silicon area of 0.00954 mm$^2$ in 0.11 $\mu$m (resp. 0.00214 mm$^2$ in 22 nm) at least 1.8$\times$ (resp. 8.2$\times$) smaller than fabricated nA-range CWT references, but with a TC improved by 6.1$\times$ (resp. 4.4$\times$).</p></details> | 14 pages, 28 figures |

Despite the effectiveness, training a powerful neural predictor with fewer annotated architectures remains a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose a context-aware neural predictor (CAP) which only needs a few annotated architectures for training based on the contextual information from the architectures. Specifically, the input architectures are encoded into graphs and the predictor infers the contextual structure around the nodes inside each graph. Then, enhanced by the proposed context-aware self-supervised task, the pre-trained predictor can obtain expressive and generalizable representations of architectures. Therefore, only a few annotated architectures are sufficient for training. Experimental results in different search spaces demonstrate the superior performance of CAP compared with state-of-the-art neural predictors. In particular, CAP can rank architectures precisely at the budget of only 172 annotated architectures in NAS-Bench-101. Moreover, CAP can help find promising architectures in both NAS-Bench-101 and DARTS search spaces on the CIFAR-10 dataset, serving as a useful navigator for NAS to explore the search space efficiently.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI24 |

An Odyssey with NAS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01975v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection is the driving force behind safe and reliable deployment of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in real world applications. However, existing studies focus on OOD detection through confidence score and deep generative model-based methods, without considering the impact of DNN structures, especially dense connectivity in architecture fabrications. In addition, existing outlier detection approaches exhibit high variance in generalization performance, lacking stability and confidence in evaluating and ranking different outlier detectors. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm, Dense Connectivity Search of Outlier Detector (DCSOD), that automatically explore the dense connectivity of CNN architectures on near-OOD detection task using Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We introduce a hierarchical search space containing versatile convolution operators and dense connectivity, allowing a flexible exploration of CNN architectures with diverse connectivity patterns. To improve the quality of evaluation on OOD detection during search, we propose evolving distillation based on our multi-view feature learning explanation. Evolving distillation stabilizes training for OOD detection evaluation, thus improves the quality of search. We thoroughly examine DCSOD on CIFAR benchmarks under OOD detection protocol. Experimental results show that DCSOD achieve remarkable performance over widely used architectures and previous NAS baselines. Notably, DCSOD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CIFAR benchmark, with AUROC improvement of $\sim$1.0%.</p></details> |  |

Robustifying Differentiable NAS with Single-Stage Searching Protocol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16610v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design neural networks for various computer vision tasks. One of its most promising subdomains is differentiable NAS (DNAS), where the optimal architecture is found in a differentiable manner. However, gradient-based methods suffer from the discretization error, which can severely damage the process of obtaining the final architecture. In our work, we first study the risk of discretization error and show how it affects an unregularized supernet. Then, we present that penalizing high entropy, a common technique of architecture regularization, can hinder the supernet's performance. Therefore, to robustify the DNAS framework, we introduce a novel single-stage searching protocol, which is not reliant on decoding a continuous architecture. Our results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other DNAS methods by achieving 75.3% in the searching stage on the Cityscapes validation dataset and attains performance 1.1% higher than the optimal network of DCNAS on the non-dense search space comprising short connections. The entire training process takes only 5.5 GPU days due to the weight reuse, and yields a computationally efficient architecture. Additionally, we propose a new dataset split procedure, which substantially improves results and prevents architecture degeneration in DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR-NAS 2024 workshop</p></details> |
