In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method based on an unsupervised paradigm, specifically Masked Autoencoders (MAE), thereby eliminating the need for labeled data. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the efficient discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) in the unsupervised setting by designing a hierarchical decoder. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, offering empirical evidence of its superiority over the counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Architecture Search for Adversarially Robust Quantum Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18058v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Quantum Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[MGAS: Multi-Granularity Architecture Search for Trade-Off Between Model Effectiveness and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15074v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has gained significant traction in automating the design of neural networks. To reduce search time, differentiable architecture search (DAS) reframes the traditional paradigm of discrete candidate sampling and evaluation into a differentiable optimization over a super-net, followed by discretization. However, most existing DAS methods primarily focus on optimizing the coarse-grained operation-level topology, while neglecting finer-grained structures such as filter-level and weight-level patterns. This limits their ability to balance model performance with model size. Additionally, many methods compromise search quality to save memory during the search process. To tackle these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Differentiable Architecture Search (MG-DARTS), a unified framework which aims to discover both effective and efficient architectures from scratch by comprehensively yet memory-efficiently exploring a multi-granularity search space. Specifically, we improve the existing DAS methods in two aspects. First, we adaptively adjust the retention ratios of searchable units across different granularity levels through adaptive pruning, which is achieved by learning granularity-specific discretization functions along with the evolving architecture. Second, we decompose the super-net optimization and discretization into multiple stages, each operating on a sub-net, and introduce progressive re-evaluation to enable re-pruning and regrowth of previous units, thereby mitigating potential bias. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that MG-DARTS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in achieving a better trade-off between model accuracy and parameter efficiency.

| **[DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiProxy-NAS: Optimization Proxy based End-to-End Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05656v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$ search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity scenarios verify the flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Model Enabled Semantic Communication Based on Robust Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02148v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Long Short-term Memory with Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14955v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) 2025</p></details> |

This work introduces MorphNAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search framework designed to address these challenges. MorphNAS enhances Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by incorporating linguistic meta-features such as script type and morphological complexity to optimize neural architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It automatically identifies optimal micro-architectural elements tailored to language-specific morphology. By automating this search, MorphNAS aims to maximize the proficiency of multilingual NLP models, leading to improved comprehension and processing of these complex languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegimeNAS: Regime-Aware Differentiable Architecture Search With Theoretical Guarantees for Financial Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11338v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2) specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching, transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs). Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive models for challenging financial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architect of the Bits World: Masked Autoregressive Modeling for Circuit Generation Guided by Truth Table](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12751v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic synthesis, a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA), optimizes gate-level circuits to minimize power consumption and area occupancy in integrated circuits (ICs). Traditional logic synthesis tools rely on human-designed heuristics, often yielding suboptimal results. Although differentiable architecture search (DAS) has shown promise in generating circuits from truth tables, it faces challenges such as high computational complexity, convergence to local optima, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Consequently, we propose a novel approach integrating conditional generative models with DAS for circuit generation. Our approach first introduces CircuitVQ, a circuit tokenizer trained based on our Circuit AutoEncoder We then develop CircuitAR, a masked autoregressive model leveraging CircuitVQ as the tokenizer. CircuitAR can generate preliminary circuit structures from truth tables, which guide DAS in producing functionally equivalent circuits. Notably, we observe the scalability and emergent capability in generating complex circuit structures of our CircuitAR models. Extensive experiments also show the superior performance of our method. This research bridges the gap between probabilistic generative models and precise circuit generation, offering a robust solution for logic synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASViT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13079v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> |
| **[DNAD: Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20080v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FX-DARTS: Designing Topology-unconstrained Architectures with Differentiable Architecture Search and Entropy-based Super-network Shrinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20079v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16306v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</p></details> |  |
| **[EM-DARTS: Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14432v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics has received increasing attention thanks to its highly secure identification. Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Channel Allocation for Robust Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04681v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and significant improvement in efficiency. However, the excessive accumulation of the skip connection, when training epochs become large, makes it suffer from weak stability and low robustness, thus limiting its practical applications. Many works have attempted to restrict the accumulation of skip connections by indicators or manual design. These methods, however, are susceptible to human priors and hyper-parameters. In this work, we suggest a more subtle and direct approach that no longer explicitly searches for skip connections in the search stage, based on the paradox that skip connections were proposed to guarantee the performance of very deep networks, but the networks in the search stage of differentiable architecture search are actually very shallow. Instead, by introducing channel importance ranking and channel allocation strategy, the skip connections are implicitly searched and automatically refilled unimportant channels in the evaluation stage. Our method, dubbed Adaptive Channel Allocation (ACA) strategy, is a general-purpose approach for differentiable architecture search, which universally works in DARTS variants without introducing human priors, indicators, or hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets and DARTS variants verify that the ACA strategy is the most effective one among existing methods in improving robustness and dealing with the collapse issue when training epochs become large.</p></details> | Accepted by TNNLS |
| **[Differentiable architecture search with multi-dimensional attention for spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00902v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained enormous popularity in the field of artificial intelligence due to their low power consumption. However, the majority of SNN methods directly inherit the structure of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), usually leading to sub-optimal model performance in SNNs. To alleviate this problem, we integrate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method and propose Multi-Attention Differentiable Architecture Search (MA-DARTS) to directly automate the search for the optimal network structure of SNNs. Initially, we defined a differentiable two-level search space and conducted experiments within micro architecture under a fixed layer. Then, we incorporated a multi-dimensional attention mechanism and implemented the MA-DARTS algorithm in this search space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification compared to other methods under the same parameters with 94.40% accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset and 76.52% accuracy on CIFAR100 dataset. Additionally, we monitored and assessed the number of spikes (NoS) in each cell during the whole experiment. Notably, the number of spikes of the whole model stabilized at approximately 110K in validation and 100k in training on datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OStr-DARTS: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search based on Operation Strength](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14433v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has emerged as a promising technique for effective neural architecture search, and it mainly contains two steps to find the high-performance architecture: First, the DARTS supernet that consists of mixed operations will be optimized via gradient descent. Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relax DARTS: Relaxing the Constraints of Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11652v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics is a secure and innovative identification method. Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $α$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $β$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CCBR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Learning Rate Scheduling for Neural Architecture Search on Long-Tailed Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07028v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we attempt to address the challenge of applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms, specifically the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), to long-tailed datasets where class distribution is highly imbalanced. We observe that traditional re-sampling and re-weighting techniques, which are effective in standard classification tasks, lead to performance degradation when combined with DARTS. To mitigate this, we propose a novel adaptive learning rate scheduling strategy tailored for the architecture parameters of DARTS when integrated with the Bilateral Branch Network (BBN) for handling imbalanced datasets. Our approach dynamically adjusts the learning rate of the architecture parameters based on the training epoch, preventing the disruption of well-trained representations in the later stages of training. Additionally, we explore the impact of branch mixing factors on the algorithm's performance. Through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an artificially induced long-tailed distribution, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to using DARTS alone. And the experiment results suggest that re-sampling methods inherently harm the performance of the DARTS algorithm. Our findings highlight the importance of careful data augment when applying DNAS to imbalanced learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient NAS with FaDE on Hierarchical Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16218v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a challenging problem. Hierarchical search spaces allow for cheap evaluations of neural network sub modules to serve as surrogate for architecture evaluations. Yet, sometimes the hierarchy is too restrictive or the surrogate fails to generalize. We present FaDE which uses differentiable architecture search to obtain relative performance predictions on finite regions of a hierarchical NAS space. The relative nature of these ranks calls for a memory-less, batch-wise outer search algorithm for which we use an evolutionary algorithm with pseudo-gradient descent. FaDE is especially suited on deep hierarchical, respectively multi-cell search spaces, which it can explore by linear instead of exponential cost and therefore eliminates the need for a proxy search space. Our experiments show that firstly, FaDE-ranks on finite regions of the search space correlate with corresponding architecture performances and secondly, the ranks can empower a pseudo-gradient evolutionary search on the complete neural architecture search space.</p></details> |  |

With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance. While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing on February 19, 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.14402</p></details> |

However, the optimal approach and the placement of PEFT methods remain inconclusive. Our study conducts extensive experiments to compare different PEFT methods and their layer-wise placement adapting Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). We also explore the use of ensemble learning to leverage diverse PEFT strategies. The results reveal that DARTS does not outperform the baseline approach, which involves inserting the same PEFT method into all layers of a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model. In contrast, an ensemble learning approach, particularly one employing majority voting, demonstrates superior performance. Our statistical evidence indicates that different PEFT methods learn in varied ways. This variation might explain why the synergistic integration of various PEFT methods through ensemble learning can harness their unique learning capabilities more effectively compared to individual layer-wise optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024 Self-supervision in Audio, Speech and Beyond (SASB) workshop</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14402v3)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical enabler of emotion-aware communication in human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have substantially enhanced the performance of SER models through increased model complexity. However, designing optimal DL architectures requires prior experience and experimental evaluations. Encouragingly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a promising avenue to determine an optimal DL model automatically. In particular, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient method of using NAS to search for optimised models. This paper proposes a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and LSTM architecture, to improve SER performance, where the literature informs the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to offer improved performance. While DARTS has previously been applied to CNN and LSTM combinations, our approach introduces a novel mechanism, particularly in selecting CNN operations using DARTS. In contrast to previous studies, we refrain from imposing constraints on the order of the layers for the CNN within the DARTS cell; instead, we allow DARTS to determine the optimal layer order autonomously. Experimenting with the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significantly higher SER accuracy than hand-engineering the CNN-LSTM configuration. It also outperforms the best-reported SER results achieved using DARTS on CNN-LSTM.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Previous works mainly adopted the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and improved its search strategies or modules to enhance search efficiency. Recently, some methods have started considering data reduction for speedup, but they are not tightly coupled with the architecture search process, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To this end, this work pioneers an exploration into the critical role of dataset characteristics for DARTS bi-level optimization, and then proposes a novel Bi-level Data Pruning (BDP) paradigm that targets the weights and architecture levels of DARTS to enhance efficiency from a data perspective. Specifically, we introduce a new progressive data pruning strategy that utilizes supernet prediction dynamics as the metric, to gradually prune unsuitable samples for DARTS during the search. An effective automatic class balance constraint is also integrated into BDP, to suppress potential class imbalances resulting from data-efficient algorithms. Comprehensive evaluations on the NAS-Bench-201 search space, DARTS search space, and MobileNet-like search space validate that BDP reduces search costs by over 50% while achieving superior performance when applied to baseline DARTS. Besides, we demonstrate that BDP can harmoniously integrate with advanced DARTS variants, like PC-DARTS and \b{eta}-DARTS, offering an approximately 2 times speedup with minimal performance compromises.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[DASS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Sparse neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06968v5)** | 2023-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices is hindered by the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing power. While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 12 figures</p></details> |

CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>NOTE:...</summary><p>NOTE: This is an expanded version of a previously published conference paper.

| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search via Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05629v2)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a simple yet efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method. During the search stage, DARTS trains a supernet by jointly optimizing architecture parameters and network parameters. During the evaluation stage, DARTS discretizes the supernet to derive the optimal architecture based on architecture parameters. However, recent research has shown that during the training process, the supernet tends to converge towards sharp minima rather than flat minima. This is evidenced by the higher sharpness of the loss landscape of the supernet, which ultimately leads to a performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. In this paper, we propose Self-Distillation Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (SD-DARTS) to alleviate the discretization gap. We utilize self-distillation to distill knowledge from previous steps of the supernet to guide its training in the current step, effectively reducing the sharpness of the supernet's loss and bridging the performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of voting teachers, where multiple previous supernets are selected as teachers, and their output probabilities are aggregated through voting to obtain the final teacher prediction. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the advantages of our novel self-distillation-based NAS method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

This is where the single-path DARTS comes in, which only chooses a single-path submodel at each step. While being memory-friendly, it also comes with low computational costs. Nonetheless, we discover a critical issue of single-path DARTS that has not been primarily noticed. Namely, it also suffers from severe performance collapse since too many parameter-free operations like skip connections are derived, just like DARTS does. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called RObustifying Memory-Efficient NAS (ROME) to give a cure. First, we disentangle the topology search from the operation search to make searching and evaluation consistent. We then adopt Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to robustify the unwieldy bi-level optimization. We verify ROME extensively across 15 benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | ICCV2023 |
| **[TND-NAS: Towards Non-differentiable Objectives in Progressive Differentiable NAS Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03892v4)** | 2023-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search has gradually become the mainstream research topic in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for its high efficiency compared with the early NAS methods. Recent differentiable NAS also aims at further improving the search performance and reducing the GPU-memory consumption. However, these methods are no longer naturally capable of tackling the non-differentiable objectives, e.g., energy, resource-constrained efficiency, and other metrics, let alone the multi-objective search demands. Researches in the multi-objective NAS field target this but requires vast computational resources cause of the sole optimization of each candidate architecture. In light of this discrepancy, we propose the TND-NAS, which is with the merits of the high efficiency in differentiable NAS framework and the compatibility among non-differentiable metrics in Multi-objective NAS. Under the differentiable NAS framework, with the continuous relaxation of the search space, TND-NAS has the architecture parameters been optimized in discrete space, while resorting to the progressive search space shrinking by architecture parameters. Our representative experiment takes two objectives (Parameters, Accuracy) as an example, we achieve a series of high-performance compact architectures on CIFAR10 (1.09M/3.3%, 2.4M/2.95%, 9.57M/2.54%) and CIFAR100 (2.46M/18.3%, 5.46/16.73%, 12.88/15.20%) datasets. Favorably, compared with other multi-objective NAS methods, TND-NAS is less time-consuming (1.3 GPU-days on NVIDIA 1080Ti, 1/6 of that in NSGA-Net), and can be conveniently adapted to real-world NAS scenarios (resource-constrained, platform-specialized).</p></details> |  |

Recent work in neural architecture search aims at automating the optimization of the DNN model implementation. However, existing neural architecture search methods for channel dimensions rely on fixed search spaces, which prevents achieving an efficient and fully automated solution. In this work, we propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search method with an efficient dynamic channel allocation algorithm to enable a flexible search space for channel dimensions. We show that the proposed framework is able to find DNN architectures that are equivalent to previous methods in task accuracy and inference latency for the CIFAR-10 dataset with an improvement of $1.3-1.7\times$ in GPU-hours and $1.5-1.7\times$ in the memory requirements during the architecture search stage. Moreover, the proposed frameworks do not require a well-engineered search space a priori, which is an important step towards fully automated design of DNN architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

DARTS then remaps the relaxed supernet back to the discrete space by one-off post-search pruning to obtain the final architecture (finalnet). Some emerging works argue that this remap is inherently prone to mismatch the network between training and evaluation which leads to performance discrepancy and even model collapse in extreme cases. We propose to close the gap between the relaxed supernet in training and the pruned finalnet in evaluation through utilizing small temperature to sparsify the continuous distribution in the training phase. To this end, we first formulate sparse-noisy softmax to get around gradient saturation. We then propose an exponential temperature schedule to better control the outbound distribution and elaborate an entropy-based adaptive scheme to finally achieve the enhancement. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficiency and efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for PAKDD 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we raise an interesting problem: can we properly measure the operation importance in DARTS through a training-free way, with avoiding the parameter-intensive bias? We investigate this question through the lens of edge connectivity, and provide an affirmative answer by defining a connectivity concept, ZERo-cost Operation Sensitivity (ZEROS), to score the importance of candidate operations in DARTS at initialization. By devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable architecture search (FreeDARTS). Based on the theory of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we show the proposed connectivity score provably negatively correlated with the generalization bound of DARTS supernet after convergence under gradient descent training. In addition, we theoretically explain how ZEROS implicitly avoids parameter-intensive bias in selecting architectures, and empirically show the searched architectures by FreeDARTS are of comparable size. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of search spaces, and results have demonstrated that FreeDARTS is a reliable and efficient baseline for neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised version with more theoretical analysis</p></details> |

Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS.

The main benefit of DAS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DAS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the success of DAS can be extended from image classification to signal reconstruction, in principle. However, our experiments also expose three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DAS-based methods in inverse problems: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is strongly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. While the results on image reconstruction confirm the potential of the DAS paradigm, they challenge the common understanding of DAS as a one-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Operation-level Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05632v1)** | 2023-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) is becoming more and more popular among Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods because of its high search efficiency and low compute cost. However, the stability of DARTS is very inferior, especially skip connections aggregation that leads to performance collapse. Though existing methods leverage Hessian eigenvalues to alleviate skip connections aggregation, they make DARTS unable to explore architectures with better performance. In the paper, we propose operation-level progressive differentiable neural architecture search (OPP-DARTS) to avoid skip connections aggregation and explore better architectures simultaneously. We first divide the search process into several stages during the search phase and increase candidate operations into the search space progressively at the beginning of each stage. It can effectively alleviate the unfair competition between operations during the search phase of DARTS by offsetting the inherent unfair advantage of the skip connection over other operations. Besides, to keep the competition between operations relatively fair and select the operation from the candidate operations set that makes training loss of the supernet largest. The experiment results indicate that our method is effective and efficient. Our method's performance on CIFAR-10 is superior to the architecture found by standard DARTS, and the transferability of our method also surpasses standard DARTS. We further demonstrate the robustness of our method on three simple search spaces, i.e., S2, S3, S4, and the results show us that our method is more robust than standard DARTS.

We view existing operation scoring functions as inexact proxies for accuracy, and we find that they perform poorly when analyzed empirically on NAS benchmarks. From this perspective, we introduce a novel \textit{perturbation-based zero-cost operation scoring} (Zero-Cost-PT) approach, which utilizes zero-cost proxies that were recently studied in multi-trial NAS but degrade significantly on larger search spaces, typical for differentiable NAS. We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on a number of NAS benchmarks and large search spaces, from NAS-Bench-201, NAS-Bench-1Shot1, NAS-Bench-Macro, to DARTS-like and MobileNet-like spaces, showing significant improvements in both search time and accuracy. On the ImageNet classification task on the DARTS search space, our approach improved accuracy compared to the best current training-free methods (TE-NAS) while being over 10$\times$ faster (total searching time 25 minutes on a single GPU), and observed significantly better transferability on architectures searched on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an accuracy increase of 1.8 pp. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zerocostptnas/zerocost_operation_score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2023</p></details> |

Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (i.e., $β$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $β$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $β$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665</p></details> |

Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $α$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we also present an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existing handcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch.

In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |

We note that DNNs must be executed under strictly hard performance constraints in real-world scenarios, for example, the runtime latency on autonomous vehicles. However, to obtain the architecture that meets the given performance constraint, previous hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search runs to manually tune the hyper-parameters by trial and error, and thus the total design cost increases proportionally. To resolve this, we introduce a lightweight hardware-aware differentiable NAS framework dubbed LightNAS, striving to find the required architecture that satisfies various performance constraints through a one-time search (i.e., \underline{\textit{you only search once}}).

However, artificial adjustment of the parameters can have a relatively obvious influence on the results. It is almost impossible to manually set the best set of parameters. Therefore this paper proposes a fully automated end-toend fake audio detection method. We first use wav2vec pre-trained model to obtain a high-level representation of the speech. Furthermore, for the network structure, we use a modified version of the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) named light-DARTS. It learns deep speech representations while automatically learning and optimizing complex neural structures consisting of convolutional operations and residual blocks. The experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our proposed system achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 1.08%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single system.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we make efforts to alleviate the performance collapse problem for DARTS from two aspects. First, we investigate the expressive power of the supernet in DARTS and then derive a new setup of DARTS paradigm with only training BatchNorm. Second, we theoretically find that random features dilute the auxiliary connection role of skip-connection in supernet optimization and enable search algorithm focus on fairer operation selection, thereby solving the performance collapse problem. We instantiate DARTS and PC-DARTS with random features to build an improved version for each named RF-DARTS and RF-PCDARTS respectively. Experimental results show that RF-DARTS obtains \textbf{94.36\%} test accuracy on CIFAR-10 (which is the nearest optimal result in NAS-Bench-201), and achieves the newest state-of-the-art top-1 test error of \textbf{24.0\%} on ImageNet when transferring from CIFAR-10. Moreover, RF-DARTS performs robustly across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN) and four search spaces (S1-S4). Besides, RF-PCDARTS achieves even better results on ImageNet, that is, \textbf{23.9\%} top-1 and \textbf{7.1\%} top-5 test error, surpassing representative methods like single-path, training-free, and partial-channel paradigms directly searched on ImageNet.</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[Efficient Joint-Dimensional Search with Solution Space Regularization for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05271v1)** | 2022-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a popular research topic in computer vision, and many efforts have been made on it with impressive results. In this paper, we intend to search an optimal network structure that can run in real-time for this problem. Towards this goal, we jointly search the depth, channel, dilation rate and feature spatial resolution, which results in a search space consisting of about 2.78*10^324 possible choices. To handle such a large search space, we leverage differential architecture search methods. However, the architecture parameters searched using existing differential methods need to be discretized, which causes the discretization gap between the architecture parameters found by the differential methods and their discretized version as the final solution for the architecture search. Hence, we relieve the problem of discretization gap from the innovative perspective of solution space regularization. Specifically, a novel Solution Space Regularization (SSR) loss is first proposed to effectively encourage the supernet to converge to its discrete one. Then, a new Hierarchical and Progressive Solution Space Shrinking method is presented to further achieve high efficiency of searching. In addition, we theoretically show that the optimization of SSR loss is equivalent to the L_0-norm regularization, which accounts for the improved search-evaluation gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed search scheme can efficiently find an optimal network structure that yields an extremely fast speed (175 FPS) of segmentation with a small model size (1 M) while maintaining comparable accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[RARTS: An Efficient First-Order Relaxed Architecture Search Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03901v2)** | 2022-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is an effective method for data-driven neural network design based on solving a bilevel optimization problem. Despite its success in many architecture search tasks, there are still some concerns about the accuracy of first-order DARTS and the efficiency of the second-order DARTS. In this paper, we formulate a single level alternative and a relaxed architecture search (RARTS) method that utilizes the whole dataset in architecture learning via both data and network splitting, without involving mixed second derivatives of the corresponding loss functions like DARTS. In our formulation of network splitting, two networks with different but related weights cooperate in search of a shared architecture. The advantage of RARTS over DARTS is justified by a convergence theorem and an analytically solvable model. Moreover, RARTS outperforms DARTS and its variants in accuracy and search efficiency, as shown in adequate experimental results. For the task of searching topological architecture, i.e., the edges and the operations, RARTS obtains a higher accuracy and 60\% reduction of computational cost than second-order DARTS on CIFAR-10. RARTS continues to out-perform DARTS upon transfer to ImageNet and is on par with recent variants of DARTS even though our innovation is purely on the training algorithm without modifying search space. For the task of searching width, i.e., the number of channels in convolutional layers, RARTS also outperforms the traditional network pruning benchmarks. Further experiments on the public architecture search benchmark like NATS-Bench also support the preeminence of RARTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley-NAS: Discovering Operation Contribution for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09811v1)** | 2022-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a Shapley value based method to evaluate operation contribution (Shapley-NAS) for neural architecture search. Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) acquires the optimal architectures by optimizing the architecture parameters with gradient descent, which significantly reduces the search cost. However, the magnitude of architecture parameters updated by gradient descent fails to reveal the actual operation importance to the task performance and therefore harms the effectiveness of obtained architectures. By contrast, we propose to evaluate the direct influence of operations on validation accuracy. To deal with the complex relationships between supernet components, we leverage Shapley value to quantify their marginal contributions by considering all possible combinations. Specifically, we iteratively optimize the supernet weights and update the architecture parameters by evaluating operation contributions via Shapley value, so that the optimal architectures are derived by selecting the operations that contribute significantly to the tasks. Since the exact computation of Shapley value is NP-hard, the Monte-Carlo sampling based algorithm with early truncation is employed for efficient approximation, and the momentum update mechanism is adopted to alleviate fluctuation of the sampling process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and various search spaces show that our Shapley-NAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin with light search cost.

| **[Incremental Learning with Differentiable Architecture and Forgetting Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09875v1)** | 2022-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As progress is made on training machine learning models on incrementally expanding classification tasks (i.e., incremental learning), a next step is to translate this progress to industry expectations. One technique missing from incremental learning is automatic architecture design via Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we show that leveraging NAS for incremental learning results in strong performance gains for classification tasks. Specifically, we contribute the following: first, we create a strong baseline approach for incremental learning based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and state-of-the-art incremental learning strategies, outperforming many existing strategies trained with similar-sized popular architectures; second, we extend the idea of architecture search to regularize architecture forgetting, boosting performance past our proposed baseline. We evaluate our method on both RF signal and image classification tasks, and demonstrate we can achieve up to a 10% performance increase over state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, our contribution enables learning from continuous distributions on real-world application data for which the complexity of the data distribution is unknown, or the modality less explored (such as RF signal classification).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2022)</p></details> |
| **[Warm-starting DARTS using meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06355v1)** | 2022-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML). NAS has outperformed hand-designed networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task, leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked. Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search (DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better. Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average by 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyclic Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10724v4)** | 2022-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search, i.e., DARTS, has drawn great attention in neural architecture search. It tries to find the optimal architecture in a shallow search network and then measures its performance in a deep evaluation network. The independent optimization of the search and evaluation networks, however, leaves room for potential improvement by allowing interaction between the two networks. To address the problematic optimization issue, we propose new joint optimization objectives and a novel Cyclic Differentiable ARchiTecture Search framework, dubbed CDARTS. Considering the structure difference, CDARTS builds a cyclic feedback mechanism between the search and evaluation networks with introspective distillation. First, the search network generates an initial architecture for evaluation, and the weights of the evaluation network are optimized. Second, the architecture weights in the search network are further optimized by the label supervision in classification, as well as the regularization from the evaluation network through feature distillation. Repeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and evaluation networks and thus enables the evolution of the architecture to fit the final evaluation network. The experiments and analysis on CIFAR, ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art ones. Specifically, in the DARTS search space, we achieve 97.52% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. In the chain-structured search space, we achieve 78.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 1.1% higher than EfficientNet-B0.

| **[Scene-adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Sequential Recommendation via Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07173v2)** | 2022-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender systems (SRS) have become a research hotspot due to its power in modeling user dynamic interests and sequential behavioral patterns. To maximize model expressive ability, a default choice is to apply a larger and deeper network architecture, which, however, often brings high network latency when generating online recommendations. Naturally, we argue that compressing the heavy recommendation models into middle- or light- weight neural networks is of great importance for practical production systems. To realize such a goal, we propose AdaRec, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework which compresses knowledge of a teacher model into a student model adaptively according to its recommendation scene by using differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we introduce a target-oriented distillation loss to guide the structure search process for finding the student network architecture, and a cost-sensitive loss as constraints for model size, which achieves a superior trade-off between recommendation effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to realize many-to-many layer mapping during knowledge distillation, which enables each intermediate student layer to learn from other intermediate teacher layers adaptively. Extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive or better accuracy with notable inference speedup comparing to strong counterparts, while discovering diverse neural architectures for sequential recommender models under different recommendation scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MS-DARTS: Mean-Shift Based Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09996v4)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an effective continuous relaxation-based network architecture search (NAS) method with low search cost. It has attracted significant attentions in Auto-ML research and becomes one of the most useful paradigms in NAS. Although DARTS can produce superior efficiency over traditional NAS approaches with better control of complex parameters, oftentimes it suffers from stabilization issues in producing deteriorating architectures when discretizing the continuous architecture. We observed considerable loss of validity causing dramatic decline in performance at this final discretization step of DARTS. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Shift based DARTS (MS-DARTS) to improve stability based on sampling and perturbation. Our approach can improve bot the stability and accuracy of DARTS, by smoothing the loss landscape and sampling architecture parameters within a suitable bandwidth. We investigate the convergence of our mean-shift approach, together with the effects of bandwidth selection that affects stability and accuracy. Evaluations performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that MS-DARTS archives higher performance over other state-of-the-art NAS methods with reduced search cost.</p></details> | 14pages |
| **[$β$-DARTS: Beta-Decay Regularization for Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01665v2)** | 2022-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search~(NAS) has attracted increasingly more attention in recent years because of its capability to design deep neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they suffer from two main issues, the weak robustness to the performance collapse and the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures. To solve these two problems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from too large. Furthermore, we provide in-depth theoretical analysis on how it works and why it works. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 show that our proposed method can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. In addition, our search scheme shows an outstanding property of being less dependent on training time and data. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | CVPR2022 |
| **[Learning from Mistakes based on Class Weighting with Application to Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00275v2)** | 2022-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from mistakes is an effective learning approach widely used in human learning, where a learner pays greater focus on mistakes to circumvent them in the future to improve the overall learning outcomes. In this work, we aim to investigate how effectively we can leverage this exceptional learning ability to improve machine learning models. We propose a simple and effective multi-level optimization framework called learning from mistakes using class weighting (LFM-CW), inspired by mistake-driven learning to train better machine learning models. In this formulation, the primary objective is to train a model to perform effectively on target tasks by using a re-weighting technique. We learn the class weights by minimizing the validation loss of the model and re-train the model with the synthetic data from the image generator weighted by class-wise performance and real data. We apply our LFM-CW framework with differential architecture search methods on image classification datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where the results show that our proposed strategy achieves lower error rate than the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZARTS: On Zero-order Optimization for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04743v2)** | 2022-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a popular one-shot paradigm for NAS due to its high efficiency. It introduces trainable architecture parameters to represent the importance of candidate operations and proposes first/second-order approximation to estimate their gradients, making it possible to solve NAS by gradient descent algorithm. However, our in-depth empirical results show that the approximation will often distort the loss landscape, leading to the biased objective to optimize and in turn inaccurate gradient estimation for architecture parameters. This work turns to zero-order optimization and proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without enforcing the above approximation. Specifically, three representative zero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which MGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed. Moreover, we explore the connections between RS/MGS and gradient descent algorithm and show that our ZARTS can be seen as a robust gradient-free counterpart to DARTS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and search spaces show the remarkable performance of our method. In particular, results on 12 benchmarks verify the outstanding robustness of ZARTS, where the performance of DARTS collapses due to its known instability issue. Also, we search on the search space of DARTS to compare with peer methods, and our discovered architecture achieves 97.54% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 75.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which are state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropNAS: Grouped Operation Dropout for Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11679v1)** | 2022-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown encouraging results in automating the architecture design. Recently, DARTS relaxes the search process with a differentiable formulation that leverages weight-sharing and SGD where all candidate operations are trained simultaneously. Our empirical results show that such procedure results in the co-adaption problem and Matthew Effect: operations with fewer parameters would be trained maturely earlier. This causes two problems: firstly, the operations with more parameters may never have the chance to express the desired function since those with less have already done the job; secondly, the system will punish those underperforming operations by lowering their architecture parameter, and they will get smaller loss gradients, which causes the Matthew Effect. In this paper, we systematically study these problems and propose a novel grouped operation dropout algorithm named DropNAS to fix the problems with DARTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DropNAS solves the above issues and achieves promising performance. Specifically, DropNAS achieves 2.26% test error on CIFAR-10, 16.39% on CIFAR-100 and 23.4% on ImageNet (with the same training hyperparameters as DARTS for a fair comparison). It is also observed that DropNAS is robust across variants of the DARTS search space. Code is available at https://github.com/wiljohnhong/DropNAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASFD: Automatic and Scalable Face Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10781v1)** | 2022-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with current multi-scale based detectors, Feature Aggregation and Enhancement (FAE) modules have shown superior performance gains for cutting-edge object detection. However, these hand-crafted FAE modules show inconsistent improvements on face detection, which is mainly due to the significant distribution difference between its training and applying corpus, COCO vs. WIDER Face. To tackle this problem, we essentially analyse the effect of data distribution, and consequently propose to search an effective FAE architecture, termed AutoFAE by a differentiable architecture search, which outperforms all existing FAE modules in face detection with a considerable margin. Upon the found AutoFAE and existing backbones, a supernet is further built and trained, which automatically obtains a family of detectors under the different complexity constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks, WIDER Face and FDDB, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance-efficiency trade-off for the proposed automatic and scalable face detector (ASFD) family. In particular, our strong ASFD-D6 outperforms the best competitor with AP 96.7/96.2/92.1 on WIDER Face test, and the lightweight ASFD-D0 costs about 3.1 ms, more than 320 FPS, on the V100 GPU with VGA-resolution images.</p></details> | ACM MM2021 |
| **[Differentiable Channel Sparsity Search via Weight Sharing within Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14714v2)** | 2022-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the differentiable channel sparsity search (DCSS) for convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional channel pruning algorithms which require users to manually set prune ratios for each convolutional layer, DCSS automatically searches the optimal combination of sparsities. Inspired by the differentiable architecture search (DARTS), we draw lessons from the continuous relaxation and leverage the gradient information to balance the computational cost and metrics. Since directly applying the scheme of DARTS causes shape mismatching and excessive memory consumption, we introduce a novel technique called weight sharing within filters. This technique elegantly eliminates the problem of shape mismatching with negligible additional resources. We conduct comprehensive experiments on not only image classification but also find-grained tasks including semantic segmentation and image super resolution to verify the effectiveness of DCSS. Compared with previous network pruning approaches, DCSS achieves state-of-the-art results for image classification. Experimental results of semantic segmentation and image super resolution indicate that task-specific search achieves better performance than transferring slim models, demonstrating the wide applicability and high efficiency of DCSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00171v1)** | 2021-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms like DARTS, the training set used to update model weight and the validation set used to update model architectures are sampled from the same data distribution. Thus, the uncommon features in the dataset fail to receive enough attention during training. In this paper, instead of introducing more complex NAS algorithms, we explore the idea that adding quality synthesized datasets into training can help the classification model identify its weakness and improve recognition accuracy. We introduce a training strategy called ``Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model(DASGM)." In DASGM, the training set is used to update the classification model weight, while a synthesized dataset is used to train its architecture. The generated images have different distributions from the training set, which can help the classification model learn better features to identify its weakness. We formulate DASGM into a multi-level optimization framework and develop an effective algorithm to solve it. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet have demonstrated the effectiveness of DASGM. Code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaLeNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search via the Bayesian Learning Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13204v1)** | 2021-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has received massive attention in recent years, mainly because it significantly reduces the computational cost through weight sharing and continuous relaxation. However, more recent works find that existing differentiable NAS techniques struggle to outperform naive baselines, yielding deteriorative architectures as the search proceeds. Rather than directly optimizing the architecture parameters, this paper formulates the neural architecture search as a distribution learning problem through relaxing the architecture weights into Gaussian distributions. By leveraging the natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI), the architecture distribution can be easily optimized based on existing codebases without incurring more memory and computational consumption. We demonstrate how the differentiable NAS benefits from Bayesian principles, enhancing exploration and improving stability. The experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmark datasets confirm the significant improvements the proposed framework can make. In addition, instead of simply applying the argmax on the learned parameters, we further leverage the recently-proposed training-free proxies in NAS to select the optimal architecture from a group architectures drawn from the optimized distribution, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmarks. Our best architecture in the DARTS search space also obtains competitive test errors with 2.37\%, 15.72\%, and 24.2\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04324v3)** | 2021-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search is prevalent in the field of NAS because of its simplicity and efficiency, where two paradigms, multi-path algorithms and single-path methods, are dominated. Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is intuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path methods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the gap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these two paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable Architecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable Gumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path sub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple sub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the optimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and sub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to improve training. The proposed framework strikes a balance between flexible memory usage and searching quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on ImageNet and CIFAR10, where the searched models show a comparable performance as the most recent approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighborhood-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06369v2)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods often return an architecture with good search performance but generalizes poorly to the test setting. To achieve better generalization, we propose a novel neighborhood-aware NAS formulation to identify flat-minima architectures in the search space, with the assumption that flat minima generalize better than sharp minima. The phrase ``flat-minima architecture'' refers to architectures whose performance is stable under small perturbations in the architecture (e.g., replacing a convolution with a skip connection). Our formulation takes the ``flatness'' of an architecture into account by aggregating the performance over the neighborhood of this architecture. We demonstrate a principled way to apply our formulation to existing search algorithms, including sampling-based algorithms and gradient-based algorithms. To facilitate the application to gradient-based algorithms, we also propose a differentiable representation for the neighborhood of architectures. Based on our formulation, we propose neighborhood-aware random search (NA-RS) and neighborhood-aware differentiable architecture search (NA-DARTS). Notably, by simply augmenting DARTS with our formulation, NA-DARTS outperforms DARTS and achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.</p></details> | BMVC 2021 |

Not surprisingly, the manual design process becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior experience, enormous effort, intuition, and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile, neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism with early stopping to automate the network design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the objective of Siamese tracking networks during offline training. Besides, the proposed early stopping strategy avoids over-fitting and performance collapse problems leading to generalization improvement. The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over five commonly-used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

Architectures designed by NAS outperform or compete with the best manual network designs in terms of accuracy, size, memory footprint and FLOPs. That said, previous studies focus on developing NAS algorithms for clean high quality data, a restrictive and somewhat unrealistic assumption. In this paper, focusing on the differentiable NAS algorithms, we show that vanilla NAS algorithms suffer from a performance loss if class labels are noisy. To combat this issue, we make use of the principle of information bottleneck as a regularizer. This leads us to develop a noise injecting operation that is included during the learning process, preventing the network from learning from noisy samples. Our empirical evaluations show that the noise injecting operation does not degrade the performance of the NAS algorithm if the data is indeed clean. In contrast, if the data is noisy, the architecture learned by our algorithm comfortably outperforms algorithms specifically equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to learn in the presence of label noise. In contrast to many algorithms designed to work in the presence of noisy labels, prior knowledge about the properties of the noise and its characteristics are not required for our algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022</p></details> |

By considering the problem as a constrained bilevel optimization, we present and analyze DARTS-PRIME, a variant including improvements to architectural weight update scheduling and regularization towards discretization. We propose a dynamic schedule based on per-minibatch network information to make architecture updates more informed, as well as proximity regularization to promote well-separated discretization. Our results in multiple domains show that DARTS-PRIME improves both performance and reliability, comparable to state-of-the-art in differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noisy Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03566v3)** | 2021-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has now become one of the mainstream paradigms of neural architecture search. However, it largely suffers from the well-known performance collapse issue due to the aggregation of skip connections. It is thought to have overly benefited from the residual structure which accelerates the information flow. To weaken this impact, we propose to inject unbiased random noise to impede the flow. We name this novel approach NoisyDARTS. In effect, a network optimizer should perceive this difficulty at each training step and refrain from overshooting, especially on skip connections. In the long run, since we add no bias to the gradient in terms of expectation, it is still likely to converge to the right solution area. We also prove that the injected noise plays a role in smoothing the loss landscape, which makes the optimization easier. Our method features extreme simplicity and acts as a new strong baseline. We perform extensive experiments across various search spaces, datasets, and tasks, where we robustly achieve state-of-the-art results. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaomi-automl/NoisyDARTS.</p></details> | BMVC 2021 |
| **[Delve into the Performance Degradation of Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13466v1)** | 2021-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is widely considered to be easy to overfit the validation set which leads to performance degradation. We first employ a series of exploratory experiments to verify that neither high-strength architecture parameters regularization nor warmup training scheme can effectively solve this problem. Based on the insights from the experiments, we conjecture that the performance of DARTS does not depend on the well-trained supernet weights and argue that the architecture parameters should be trained by the gradients which are obtained in the early stage rather than the final stage of training. This argument is then verified by exchanging the learning rate schemes of weights and parameters. Experimental results show that the simple swap of the learning rates can effectively solve the degradation and achieve competitive performance. Further empirical evidence suggests that the degradation is not a simple problem of the validation set overfitting but exhibit some links between the degradation and the operation selection bias within bilevel optimization dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of this bias and propose to utilize this bias to achieve an operation-magnitude-based selective stop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at the CIKM 2021 conference</p></details> |

Differentiable architecture search converts the search over discrete architectures into a hyperparameter optimization problem which can be solved by gradient descent. However, questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness and generalizability of gradient methods for solving non-convex architecture hyperparameter optimization problems. In this paper, we propose L$^{2}$NAS, which learns to intelligently optimize and update architecture hyperparameters via an actor neural network based on the distribution of high-performing architectures in the search history. We introduce a quantile-driven training procedure which efficiently trains L$^{2}$NAS in an actor-critic framework via continuous-action reinforcement learning. Experiments show that L$^{2}$NAS achieves state-of-the-art results on NAS-Bench-201 benchmark as well as DARTS search space and Once-for-All MobileNetV3 search space. We also show that search policies generated by L$^{2}$NAS are generalizable and transferable across different training datasets with minimal fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Full Research Paper at CIKM 2021; 10 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[iDARTS: Improving DARTS by Node Normalization and Decorrelation Discretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11014v1)** | 2021-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) uses a continuous relaxation of network representation and dramatically accelerates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by almost thousands of times in GPU-day. However, the searching process of DARTS is unstable, which suffers severe degradation when training epochs become large, thus limiting its application. In this paper, we claim that this degradation issue is caused by the imbalanced norms between different nodes and the highly correlated outputs from various operations. We then propose an improved version of DARTS, namely iDARTS, to deal with the two problems. In the training phase, it introduces node normalization to maintain the norm balance. In the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based on the similarity between the outputs of the node and the decorrelated operations rather than the values of the architecture parameters. Extensive evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and the error rates of 2.25\% and 24.7\% are reported within 0.2 and 1.9 GPU-day for architecture search respectively, which shows its effectiveness. Additional analysis also reveals that iDARTS has the advantage in robustness and generalization over other DARTS-based counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-DARTS: Towards Stable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08128v1)** | 2021-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) marks a milestone in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), boasting simplicity and small search costs. However, DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the architecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization, Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective method will give some insights on differential architecture search.

However, the network performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of predictions.</p></details> |  |

In ASR field especially end-to-end ASR, the related research is still in its infancy. In this work, we focus on applying NAS on the most popular manually designed model: Conformer, and then propose an efficient ASR model searching method that benefits from the natural advantage of differentiable architecture search (Darts) in reducing computational overheads. We fuse Darts mutator and Conformer blocks to form a complete search space, within which a modified architecture called Darts-Conformer cell is found automatically. The entire searching process on AISHELL-1 dataset costs only 0.7 GPU days. Replacing the Conformer encoder by stacking searched cell, we get an end-to-end ASR model (named as Darts-Conformner) that outperforms the Conformer baseline by 4.7\% on the open-source AISHELL-1 dataset. Besides, we verify the transferability of the architecture searched on a small dataset to a larger 2k-hour dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to apply gradient-based architecture search in the attention-based encoder-decoder ASR model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASRU 2021</p></details> |

The intrinsic problem complexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative networks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of network architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated architecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable search framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The searching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization problem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network architecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the discriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the inner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by alternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable manner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search space. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our algorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a single GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible configurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the searching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would benefit further research on architectures for generative models.

An example of neural architecture search, DARTS operates upon a continuous, differentiable search space which enables both the architecture and parameters to be optimised via gradient descent. Solutions based on partially-connected DARTS use random channel masking in the search space to reduce GPU time and automatically learn and optimise complex neural architectures composed of convolutional operations and residual blocks.

| **[iDARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search with Stochastic Implicit Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10784v1)** | 2021-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has recently become the mainstream of neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and simplicity. With a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path. To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming, with large margins, those learned by the baseline methods.</p></details> | ICML2021 |

It is extended from the existing study on differentiable neural architecture search, and we made the backbone architecture transformable rather than fixed during the training process. As is known, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) requires a pre-defined over-parameterized backbone architecture, while its size is to be determined manually. Also, in DARTS backbone, Hadamard product of two elements is not introduced, which exists in both LSTM and GRU cells for recurrent nets. This study introduces a growing mechanism for differentiable neural architecture search based on network morphism. It enables growing of the cell structures from small size towards large size ones with one-shot training. Two modes can be applied in integrating the growing and original pruning process. We also implement a recently proposed two-input backbone architecture for recurrent neural networks. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach and the two-input backbone structure can be quite effective compared with other baseline architectures including LSTM, in a variety of learning tasks including multi-variate time series forecasting and language modeling. On the other hand, we find that dynamic network transformation is promising in improving the efficiency of differentiable architecture search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event Classification with Multi-step Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02301v1)** | 2021-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usefulness and value of Multi-step Machine Learning (ML), where a task is organized into connected sub-tasks with known intermediate inference goals, as opposed to a single large model learned end-to-end without intermediate sub-tasks, is presented. Pre-optimized ML models are connected and better performance is obtained by re-optimizing the connected one. The selection of an ML model from several small ML model candidates for each sub-task has been performed by using the idea based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and Single Path One-Shot NAS (SPOS-NAS) are tested, where the construction of loss functions is improved to keep all ML models smoothly learning. Using DARTS and SPOS-NAS as an optimization and selection as well as the connections for multi-step machine learning systems, we find that (1) such a system can quickly and successfully select highly performant model combinations, and (2) the selected models are consistent with baseline algorithms, such as grid search, and their outputs are well controlled.</p></details> |  |

However, directly using DARTS for Transformers is memory-intensive, which renders the search process infeasible. To this end, we propose a multi-split reversible network and combine it with DARTS. Specifically, we devise a backpropagation-with-reconstruction algorithm so that we only need to store the last layer's outputs. By relieving the memory burden for DARTS, it allows us to search with larger hidden size and more candidate operations. We evaluate the searched architecture on three sequence-to-sequence datasets, i.e., WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French, and WMT'14 English-Czech. Experimental results show that our network consistently outperforms standard Transformers across the tasks. Moreover, our method compares favorably with big-size Evolved Transformers, reducing search computation by an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2021</p></details> |

Yet, researchers are beginning to accumulate increasing amounts of data without having the temporal or monetary resources to integrate these data into scientific theories. We seek to overcome these limitations by incorporating existing machine learning techniques into an open-source pipeline for the automated construction of quantitative models. This pipeline leverages the use of neural architecture search to automate the discovery of interpretable model architectures, and automatic differentiation to automate the fitting of model parameters to data. We evaluate the utility of these methods based on their ability to recover quantitative models of human information processing from synthetic data. We find that these methods are capable of recovering basic quantitative motifs from models of psychophysics, learning and decision making. We also highlight weaknesses of this framework and discuss future directions for their mitigation.</p></details> |  |

In arrhythmia detection, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an important diagnostic technique. However, manually evaluating ECG signals is a complicated and time-consuming task. With the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the evaluation process has been accelerated and the performance is improved. It is noteworthy that the performance of CNNs heavily depends on their architecture design, which is a complex process grounded on expert experience and trial-and-error. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Heart-Darts, to efficiently classify the ECG signals by automatically designing the CNN model with the differentiable architecture search (i.e., Darts, a cell-based neural architecture search method). Specifically, we initially search a cell architecture by Darts and then customize a novel CNN model for ECG classification based on the obtained cells. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed method, we evaluate the constructed model on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Additionally, the extensibility of the proposed CNN model is validated on two other new databases. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art CNN models in ECG classification in terms of both performance and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalisable Omni-Scale Representations for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06827v5)** | 2021-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective person re-identification (re-ID) model should learn feature representations that are both discriminative, for distinguishing similar-looking people, and generalisable, for deployment across datasets without any adaptation. In this paper, we develop novel CNN architectures to address both challenges. First, we present a re-ID CNN termed omni-scale network (OSNet) to learn features that not only capture different spatial scales but also encapsulate a synergistic combination of multiple scales, namely omni-scale features. The basic building block consists of multiple convolutional streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. For omni-scale feature learning, a unified aggregation gate is introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with channel-wise weights. OSNet is lightweight as its building blocks comprise factorised convolutions. Second, to improve generalisable feature learning, we introduce instance normalisation (IN) layers into OSNet to cope with cross-dataset discrepancies. Further, to determine the optimal placements of these IN layers in the architecture, we formulate an efficient differentiable architecture search algorithm. Extensive experiments show that, in the conventional same-dataset setting, OSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, despite being much smaller than existing re-ID models. In the more challenging yet practical cross-dataset setting, OSNet beats most recent unsupervised domain adaptation methods without using any target data.

NAS can be performed via policy gradient, evolutionary algorithms, differentiable architecture search or tree-search methods. While significant progress has been made for both policy gradient and differentiable architecture search, tree-search methods have so far failed to achieve comparable accuracy or search efficiency. In this paper, we formulate NAS as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) problem (CMAB-NAS). This allows the decomposition of a large search space into smaller blocks where tree-search methods can be applied more effectively and efficiently. We further leverage a tree-based method called Nested Monte-Carlo Search to tackle the CMAB-NAS problem. On CIFAR-10, our approach discovers a cell structure that achieves a low error rate that is comparable to the state-of-the-art, using only 0.58 GPU days, which is 20 times faster than current tree-search methods. Moreover, the discovered structure transfers well to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Making Differentiable Architecture Search less local](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10450v1)** | 2021-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a recent methodology for automating the design of neural network architectures. Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a promising NAS approach that dramatically increases search efficiency. However, it has been shown to suffer from performance collapse, where the search often leads to detrimental architectures. Many recent works try to address this issue of DARTS by identifying indicators for early stopping, regularising the search objective to reduce the dominance of some operations, or changing the parameterisation of the search problem. In this work, we hypothesise that performance collapses can arise from poor local optima around typical initial architectures and weights. We address this issue by developing a more global optimisation scheme that is able to better explore the space without changing the DARTS problem formulation. Our experiments show that our changes in the search algorithm allow the discovery of architectures with both better test performance and fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021 Workshop on Neural Architecture Search</p></details> |

NAS can derive a SOTA and data-specific architecture over validation data from a pre-defined search space with a search algorithm. Inspired by the success of NAS in ASR tasks, we propose a NAS-based ASR framework containing one search space and one differentiable search algorithm called Differentiable Architecture Search(DARTS). Our search space follows the convolution-augmented transformer(Conformer) backbone, which is a more expressive ASR architecture than those used in existing NAS-based ASR frameworks. To improve the performance of our method, a regulation method called Dynamic Search Schedule(DSS) is employed. On a widely used Mandarin benchmark AISHELL-1, our best-searched architecture outperforms the baseline Conform model significantly with about 11% CER relative improvement, and our method is proved to be pretty efficient by the search cost comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to INTERSPEECH 2021</p></details> |

However, these backbones may not be computationally efficient or the most suitable architectures for ReID. In this work, we aim to design a lightweight and suitable network for ReID. We propose a novel search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS), based on which we search for an efficient network architecture, which we call CDNet, via a differentiable architecture search algorithm. Through the use of the combined basic building blocks in CDS, CDNet tends to focus on combined pattern information that is typically found in images of pedestrians. We then propose a low-cost search strategy named the Top-k Sample Search strategy to make full use of the search space and avoid trapping in local optimal result. Furthermore, an effective Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck), which is removable at the inference time, is presented to balance the effects of triplet loss and softmax loss during the training process. Extensive experiments show that our CDNet (~1.8M parameters) has comparable performance with state-of-the-art lightweight networks.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2021 |
| **[DOTS: Decoupling Operation and Topology in Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00969v3)** | 2021-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted extensive attention due to its efficiency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |

However, the architectures obtained by existing NAS approaches are optimized only for classification performance and do not adapt to devices with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network architecture search algorithm aiming to simultaneously improve network performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and reduce network complexity. The proposed framework automatically builds the network architecture at two stages: block-level search and network-level search. At the stage of block-level search, a relaxation method based on the gradient is proposed, using an enhanced gradient to design high-performance and low-complexity blocks. At the stage of network-level search, we apply an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm to complete the automatic design from blocks to the target network. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms all evaluated hand-crafted networks in image classification, with an error rate of on CIFAR10 and an error rate of on CIFAR100, both at network parameter size less than one megabit. Moreover, compared with other neural architecture search methods, our method offers a tremendous reduction in designed network architecture parameters.</p></details> |  |

With recently developed pathwise derivatives, the Dirichlet parameters can be easily optimized with gradient-based optimizer in an end-to-end manner. This formulation improves the generalization ability and induces stochasticity that naturally encourages exploration in the search space. Furthermore, to alleviate the large memory consumption of differentiable NAS, we propose a simple yet effective progressive learning scheme that enables searching directly on large-scale tasks, eliminating the gap between search and evaluation phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we obtain a test error of 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 23.7% for ImageNet under the mobile setting.

It defines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which represents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the network and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method finds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a model with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the resulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a model with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization with the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion. Specifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS selects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M parameters within 0.3 GPU-days on CIFAR-10, and a top-1 error rate of 23.9% on ImageNet.

| **[DARTS-: Robustly Stepping out of Performance Collapse Without Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01027v2)** | 2021-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the fast development of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), it suffers from long-standing performance instability, which extremely limits its application. Existing robustifying methods draw clues from the resulting deteriorated behavior instead of finding out its causing factor. Various indicators such as Hessian eigenvalues are proposed as a signal to stop searching before the performance collapses. However, these indicator-based methods tend to easily reject good architectures if the thresholds are inappropriately set, let alone the searching is intrinsically noisy. In this paper, we undertake a more subtle and direct approach to resolve the collapse. We first demonstrate that skip connections have a clear advantage over other candidate operations, where it can easily recover from a disadvantageous state and become dominant. We conjecture that this privilege is causing degenerated performance. Therefore, we propose to factor out this benefit with an auxiliary skip connection, ensuring a fairer competition for all operations. We call this approach DARTS-. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify that it can substantially improve robustness.

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves over prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO.

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceNAS: Zero-shot LLM Pruning via Gradient Trace Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02891v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured pruning is essential for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The varying sensitivity of LLM sub-blocks to pruning necessitates the identification of optimal non-uniformly pruned models. Existing methods evaluate the importance of layers, attention heads, or weight channels in isolation. Such localized focus ignores the complex global structural dependencies that exist across the model. Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | Preprint |

By adhering to 'Green AI' principles, the framework explicitly minimizes computational energy costs and carbon footprints, prioritizing sustainable deployment over raw computational scale. The Green-NAS architecture search method is optimized for both model accuracy and efficiency to find lightweight models with high accuracy and very few model parameters; this is accomplished through an optimization process that simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives. Our best-performing model, Green-NAS-A, achieved an RMSE of 0.0988 (i.e., within 1.4% of our manually tuned baseline) using only 153k model parameters, which is 239 times fewer than other globally applied weather forecasting models, such as GraphCast. In addition, we also describe how the use of transfer learning will improve the weather forecasting accuracy by approximately 5.2%, in comparison to a naive approach of training a new model for each city, when there is limited historical weather data available for that city.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQUAD: Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions via ensemble of early exit neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22711v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit neural networks have become popular for reducing inference latency by allowing intermediate predictions when sufficient confidence is achieved. However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method based on an unsupervised paradigm, specifically Masked Autoencoders (MAE), thereby eliminating the need for labeled data. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the efficient discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) in the unsupervised setting by designing a hierarchical decoder. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, offering empirical evidence of its superiority over the counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11576v6)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, quantum architecture search, unsupervised representation learning</p></details> |

However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers faces reliability challenges, particularly from Out-of-Distribution (OOD) pathologies and noise. Standard classifiers often yield high-confidence errors on such data. Existing OOD detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately. This paper investigates Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as a lightweight, upstream filtering mechanism. We perform a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on six UAD approaches, including Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD), input reconstruction with (Variational-)Autoencoders (AE/VAE), Masked Anomaly Detection (MAD), Normalizing Flows (NFs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) under strict hardware constraints ($\leq$512k parameters), suitable for microcontrollers. Evaluating on the PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets, we demonstrate that a NAS-optimized Deep SVDD offers the superior Pareto efficiency between detection performance and model size. In a simulated deployment, this lightweight filter improves the accuracy of a diagnostic classifier by up to 21.0 percentage points, demonstrating that optimized UAD filters can safeguard ECG analysis on wearables.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, LaTeX; Accepted at the 5th IEEE Workshop on Pervasive and Resource-constrained Artificial Intelligence (PeRConAI) 2026; Shortened the text and removed Fig. 2 and Table II, results unchanged; updated faculty name of one author</p></details> |

This renders the traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) ineffective compared to the advances in deep learning. However, the success of such methods is increasingly associated with the ease of their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones. This work presents a novel mobile-friendly network for image de-noising obtained with Entropy-Regularized differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on a hardware-aware search space for a U-Net architecture, which is first-of-its-kind. The designed model has 12% less parameters, with ~2-fold improvement in ondevice latency and 1.5-fold improvement in the memory footprint for a 0.7% drop in PSNR, when deployed and profiled on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Compared to the SOTA Swin-Transformer for Image Restoration, the proposed network had competitive accuracy with ~18-fold reduction in GMACs. Further, the network was tested successfully for Gaussian de-noising with 3 intensities on 4 benchmarks and real-world de-noising on 1 benchmark demonstrating its generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Linear attention mechanisms offer linear or near-linear scaling yet often incur performance degradation. Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Loop LLM Discovery of Non-Standard Channel Priors in Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08517v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel configuration search the optimization of layer specifications such as layer widths in deep neural networks presents a complex combinatorial challenge constrained by tensor shape compatibility and computational budgets. We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Robustness Barriers in Cognitive Diagnosis: A One-Shot Neural Architecture Search Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04918v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of network technologies, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have emerged to deliver increasingly precise and tailored personalized learning services. Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks.</p></details> | KDD2026, 15 pages |

While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Model-Based Optimization: Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17286v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline optimization is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering, where the goal is to optimize black-box functions using only offline datasets. This setting is particularly relevant when querying the objective function is prohibitively expensive or infeasible, with applications spanning protein engineering, material discovery, neural architecture search, and beyond. The main difficulty lies in accurately estimating the objective landscape beyond the available data, where extrapolations are fraught with significant epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty can lead to objective hacking(reward hacking), exploiting model inaccuracies in unseen regions, or other spurious optimizations that yield misleadingly high performance estimates outside the training distribution. Recent advances in model-based optimization(MBO) have harnessed the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks to develop offline-specific surrogate and generative models. Trained with carefully designed strategies, these models are more robust against out-of-distribution issues, facilitating the discovery of improved designs. Despite its growing impact in accelerating scientific discovery, the field lacks a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we present the first thorough review of offline MBO. We begin by formalizing the problem for both single-objective and multi-objective settings and by reviewing recent benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We then categorize existing approaches into two key areas: surrogate modeling, which emphasizes accurate function approximation in out-of-distribution regions, and generative modeling, which explores high-dimensional design spaces to identify high-performing designs. Finally, we examine the key challenges and propose promising directions for advancement in this rapidly evolving field including safe control of superintelligent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2026 (Survey Certification)</p></details> |

The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behavior in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search: also called {\it compression aware training}. The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography during training: method accelerates and supports lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. The proposition is supported with the experimental evidence, resulting in very high correlation between learning performance vs. Gibbs entropy over compression ratios. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm, 1 theorem</p></details> |

This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms.

However, NAS suffers from a critical bottleneck, i.e. the evaluation of numerous architectures during the search process demands substantial computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. Beyond classification accuracy, real-world applications increasingly demand more efficient and compact network architectures that balance multiple performance criteria. To address these challenges, we propose the SMEMNAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEMNAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e. a main population that guides the evolutionary process, while a vice population that enhances search diversity. Our method aims to discover high-performance models that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEMNAS which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570M on the ImageNet.

Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[Learning Informative Attention Weights for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08961v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms have been widely used in deep learning, and recent efforts have been devoted to incorporating attention modules into deep neural networks (DNNs) for person Re-Identification (Re-ID) to enhance their discriminative feature learning capabilities. Existing attention modules, including self-attention and channel attention, learn attention weights that quantify the importance of feature tokens or feature channels. However, existing attention methods do not explicitly ensure that the attention weights are informative for predicting the identity of the person in the input image, and may consequently introduce noisy information from the input image. To address this issue, we propose a novel method termed Reduction of Information Bottleneck loss (RIB), motivated by the principle of the Information Bottleneck (IB). A novel distribution-free and efficient variational upper bound for the IB loss (IBB), which can be optimized by standard SGD, is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the RIB models. RIB is applied to DNNs with self-attention modules through a novel Differentiable Channel Selection Attention module, or DCS-Attention, that selects the most informative channels for computing attention weights, leading to competitive models termed RIB-DCS. RIB is also incorporated into DNNs with existing channel attention modules to promote the learning of informative channel attention weights, leading to models termed RIB-CA. Both RIB-DCS and RIB-CA are applied to fixed neural network backbones and learnable backbones with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS). Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks show that RIB significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of DNNs for person Re-ID, even for the occluded person Re-ID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with Dual Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20112v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.</p></details> | 26 pages |

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The Manuscript is submitted for review under IEEE Transactions on Artificial intelligence</p></details> |

We present Surrogate Neural Architecture Codesign Package (SNAC-Pack), an integrated framework that automates the discovery and optimization of neural networks focusing on FPGA deployment. SNAC-Pack combines Neural Architecture Codesign's multi-stage search capabilities with the Resource Utilization and Latency Estimator, enabling multi-objective optimization across accuracy, FPGA resource utilization, and latency without requiring time-intensive synthesis for each candidate model. We demonstrate SNAC-Pack on a high energy physics jet classification task, achieving 63.84% accuracy with resource estimation. When synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU13P FPGA, the SNAC-Pack model matches baseline accuracy while maintaining comparable resource utilization to models optimized using traditional BOPs metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware neural architecture search for resource-constrained deployments and provides an open-source framework for automating the design of efficient FPGA-accelerated models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, 8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems</p></details> |

While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data "first principles" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 ttables</p></details> |

Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

| **[LLM-Driven Composite Neural Architecture Search for Multi-Source RL State Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06982v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing state encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple information sources -- such as sensor measurements, time-series signals, image observations, and textual instructions -- remains underexplored and often requires manual design. We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline in which the LLM serves as a neural architecture design agent, leveraging language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders. On a mixed-autonomy traffic control task, our approach discovers higher-performing architectures with fewer candidate evaluations than traditional NAS baselines and the LLM-based GENIUS framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models for Reasoning and Planning</p></details> |
| **[AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10671v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

To audit this robustness, we design a poisoning framework that enables the systematic evaluation of the ability of NAS to produce architectures under data corruption. Our framework examines four off-the-shelf NAS algorithms, representing different approaches to architecture discovery, against four data poisoning attacks, including one we tailor specifically for NAS. In our evaluation with the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks, we show that NAS is \emph{seemingly} robust to data poisoning, showing marginal accuracy drops even under large poisoning budgets. However, we demonstrate that when considering NAS algorithms designed to achieve a few percentage points of accuracy gain, this expected improvement can be substantially diminished under data poisoning. We also show that the reduction varies across NAS algorithms and analyze the factors contributing to their robustness. Our findings are: (1) Training-based NAS algorithms are the least robust due to their reliance on data. (2) Training-free NAS approaches are the most robust but produce architectures that perform similarly to random selections from the search space. (3) NAS algorithms can produce architectures with improved accuracy, even when using out-of-distribution data like MNIST. We lastly discuss potential countermeasures.

We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.</p></details> |  |

Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose LLM-NAS: an LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed LLM-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, LLM-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this we need effective search algorithms that can identify powerful components and reuse them in new candidate architectures. In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing demand for embedded intelligence at the edge imposes stringent computational and energy constraints, challenging the deployment of these large-scale models. Early Exiting Neural Networks (EENN) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing dynamic termination of inference based on input complexity to enhance efficiency. Despite their potential, EENN performance is highly influenced by the heterogeneity of edge accelerators and the constraints imposed by quantization, affecting accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Yet, research on the automatic optimization of EENN design for edge hardware remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that systematically integrates the effects of quantization and hardware resource allocation to optimize the placement of early exit points within a network backbone. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our NAS framework can discover architectures that achieve over a 50\% reduction in computational costs compared to conventional static networks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> |

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.</p></details> |  |

While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.</p></details> |  |

Time-to-first-spike (TTFS)-coded spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution, as each neuron emits at most one binary spike, resulting in extremely sparse and energy-efficient computation. While prior works have primarily focused on improving TTFS SNN training algorithms, the impact of network architecture has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose TNAS-ER, the first neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored to TTFS SNNs for eye-based emotion recognition. TNAS-ER presents a novel ANN-assisted search strategy that leverages a ReLU-based ANN counterpart sharing an identity mapping with the TTFS SNN to guide architecture optimization. TNAS-ER employs an evolutionary algorithm, with weighted and unweighted average recall jointly defined as fitness objectives for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNAS-ER achieves high recognition performance with significantly improved efficiency. Furthermore, when deployed on neuromorphic hardware, TNAS-ER attains a low latency of 48 ms and an energy consumption of 0.05 J, confirming its superior energy efficiency and strong potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)</p></details> |

The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency.

To reduce search time, differentiable architecture search (DAS) reframes the traditional paradigm of discrete candidate sampling and evaluation into a differentiable optimization over a super-net, followed by discretization. However, most existing DAS methods primarily focus on optimizing the coarse-grained operation-level topology, while neglecting finer-grained structures such as filter-level and weight-level patterns. This limits their ability to balance model performance with model size. Additionally, many methods compromise search quality to save memory during the search process. To tackle these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Differentiable Architecture Search (MG-DARTS), a unified framework which aims to discover both effective and efficient architectures from scratch by comprehensively yet memory-efficiently exploring a multi-granularity search space. Specifically, we improve the existing DAS methods in two aspects. First, we adaptively adjust the retention ratios of searchable units across different granularity levels through adaptive pruning, which is achieved by learning granularity-specific discretization functions along with the evolving architecture. Second, we decompose the super-net optimization and discretization into multiple stages, each operating on a sub-net, and introduce progressive re-evaluation to enable re-pruning and regrowth of previous units, thereby mitigating potential bias. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that MG-DARTS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in achieving a better trade-off between model accuracy and parameter efficiency.

While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages,5 figures,6 tables</p></details> |

They are ubiquitous in machine learning and artificial intelligence and the choice of their values determines the effectiveness of systems based on these technologies. Manual hyperparameter search is often time-consuming and becomes infeasible when the number of hyperparameters is large. Automating the search is an important step towards advancing, streamlining, and systematizing machine learning, freeing researchers and practitioners alike from the burden of finding a good set of hyperparameters by trial and error. In this survey, we present a unified treatment of hyperparameter optimization, providing the reader with examples, insights into the state-of-the-art, and numerous links to further reading. We cover the main families of techniques to automate hyperparameter search, often referred to as hyperparameter optimization or tuning, including random and quasi-random search, bandit-, model-, population-, and gradient-based approaches. We further discuss extensions, including online, constrained, and multi-objective formulations, touch upon connections with other fields, such as meta-learning and neural architecture search, and conclude with open questions and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MAL-088</p></details> |

It comprises 23M total parameters, trained on a single A100 GPU in less than a week using a new synthetic data generation and data augmentation pipeline (SynthTS). Without any neural architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, or scaling up model size, Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of time series benchmark datasets, often outperforming much larger models and even matching the performance of much larger, industrial-scale, likely highly tuned foundation models. Specifically, Tiny-TSM outperforms all other time series foundation models we evaluated on medium- and long-term forecasting tasks under MSE loss, while short-term accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art models. We also introduce a causal input normalization scheme that enables time series models to be trained with dense next-token prediction loss, significantly accelerating convergence speed and reducing training time. All experiments were conducted on a single A100 GPU, illustrating the practicality of the proposed approach in a resource-constrained setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search for Quantum Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19246v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5% of performance attained by full-scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high-performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |

However, the design of neural architectures for LT settings has received limited attention, despite evidence showing that architecture choices can substantially affect performance. This paper aims to bridge the gap between LT challenges and neural network design by providing an in-depth analysis of how various architectures influence LT performance. Specifically, we systematically examine the effects of key network components on LT handling, such as topology, convolutions, and activation functions. Based on these observations, we propose two convolutional operations optimized for improved performance. Recognizing that operation interactions are also crucial to network effectiveness, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to facilitate efficient exploration. We propose LT-DARTS, a NAS method with a novel search space and search strategy specifically designed for LT data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing architectures across multiple LT datasets, achieving parameter-efficient, state-of-the-art results when integrated with current LT methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |
| **[Weight-Entanglement Meets Gradient-Based Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10440v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in neural architecture search (NAS), enabling gradient-based methods to explore cell-based architectural spaces significantly faster than traditional black-box approaches. In parallel, weight-entanglement has emerged as a technique for more intricate parameter sharing amongst macro-architectural spaces. Since weight-entanglement is not directly compatible with gradient-based NAS methods, these two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods, while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces.

Prior approaches have relied on manually designed, complex network architectures to improve multi-scale feature extraction. However, such handcrafted models offer limited gains when prior knowledge is inadequate and are prone to overfitting on small datasets. In this paper, we introduce DeNAS-ViT, a data-efficient NAS-optimized Vision Transformer, the first method to leverage neural architecture search (NAS) for ultrasound image segmentation by automatically optimizing model architecture through token-level search. Specifically, we propose an efficient NAS module that performs multi-scale token search prior to the ViT's attention mechanism, effectively capturing both contextual and local features while minimizing computational costs. Given ultrasound's data scarcity and NAS's inherent data demands, we further develop a NAS-guided semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. This approach integrates network independence and contrastive learning within a stage-wise optimization strategy, significantly enhancing model robustness under limited-data conditions. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DeNAS-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness with minimal labeled data. Moreover, we highlight DeNAS-ViT's generalization potential beyond ultrasound imaging, underscoring its broader applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-26 Main Technical Track</p></details> |

This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs. Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications like neural architecture search and deepens our understanding of redundancies in large graphs. Despite the rapid development of GC methods, particularly for node classification, a unified evaluation framework is still lacking to systematically compare different GC methods or clarify key design choices for improving their effectiveness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{GC4NC}, a comprehensive framework for evaluating diverse GC methods on node classification across multiple dimensions including performance, efficiency, privacy preservation, denoising ability, NAS effectiveness, and transferability. Our systematic evaluation offers novel insights into how condensed graphs behave and the critical design choices that drive their success.

We modify the commonly used "divide and conquer" framework in parallel computing by adding a correlation-based clustering step, transforming it into "clustering and conquer". Analytical results under a symmetric benchmark scenario show that this seemingly simple modification yields an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ reduction in sample complexity for a widely used class of sample-optimal R&S procedures. Our approach enjoys two key advantages: 1) it does not require highly accurate correlation estimation or precise clustering, and 2) it allows for seamless integration with various existing R&S procedures, while achieving optimal sample complexity. Theoretically, we develop a novel gradient analysis framework to analyze sample efficiency and guide the design of large-scale R&S procedures. We also introduce a new parallel clustering algorithm tailored for large-scale scenarios. Finally, in large-scale AI applications such as neural architecture search, our methods demonstrate superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Full version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15734v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |

Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper to ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

However, BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains. Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly, we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow or complex algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search for global multi-step Forecasting of Energy Production Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00035v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic energy sector requires both predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency for short-term forecasting of energy generation under operational constraints, where timely and precise predictions are crucial. The manual configuration of complex methods, which can generate accurate global multi-step predictions without suffering from a computational bottleneck, represents a procedure with significant time requirements and high risk for human-made errors. A further intricacy arises from the temporal dynamics present in energy-related data. Additionally, the generalization to unseen data is imperative for continuously deploying forecasting techniques over time. To overcome these challenges, in this research, we design a neural architecture search (NAS)-based framework for the automated discovery of time series models that strike a balance between computational efficiency, predictive performance, and generalization power for the global, multi-step short-term forecasting of energy production time series. In particular, we introduce a search space consisting only of efficient components, which can capture distinctive patterns of energy time series. Furthermore, we formulate a novel objective function that accounts for performance generalization in temporal context and the maximal exploration of different regions of our high-dimensional search space. The results obtained on energy production time series show that an ensemble of lightweight architectures discovered with NAS outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, such as Transformers, as well as pre-trained forecasting models, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNAS methods still require intensive human labor and rich domain knowledge when designing the search space and search strategy. To this end, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into GNAS and present a new GNAS model based on LLMs (GNAS-LLM for short). The basic idea of GNAS-LLM is to design a new class of GNAS prompts for LLMs to guide LLMs towards understanding the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running LLMs with the prompts, GNAS-LLM generates more accurate graph neural network architectures with fast convergence. Experimental results show that GNAS-LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods on four benchmark graph datasets, with an average improvement of 0.7% on the validation sets and 0.3% on the test sets. Besides, GNAS-LLM achieves an average improvement of 1.0% on the test sets based on the search space from AutoGEL.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising machine learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection. Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions.

While AI-based approaches had been proposed by prior works to assist ransomware detection, existing methods suffer from three major limitations, ad-hoc feature dependencies, delayed response, and limited adaptability to unseen variants. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with neural architecture search (NAS) to address these challenges. Specifically, this paper offers three important contributions. (1) We design a contrastive learning framework that incorporates hardware performance counters (HPC) to analyze the runtime behavior of target ransomware.

| **[Neural Attention Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13251v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |
| **[An Integrated Approach to Neural Architecture Search for Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19872v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training. This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as a dynamic component of the learning process itself.</p></details> |  |

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Godel machines offer a principled safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code; however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings. We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level, while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems.Code is available at: https://github.com/gravitywavelet/sgm-anon.</p></details> |  |
| **[GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20725v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS) 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations, enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and (iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data.

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural network architecture instantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at: https://github.com/shiwenqin/ONNX-Net</p></details> |

However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |

This paper introduces AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods face critical limitations, including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction. CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its excellent generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory (CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters, quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of 73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs.

| **[Pretrained Hybrids with MAD Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00894v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently proposed hybrid architectures seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose Manticore, a framework that addresses these challenges by automating the design of hybrid architectures while reusing pretrained models to create pretrained hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to program pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids match existing manually designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena, and improve on pretrained transformers and state space models on various natural language tasks.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\% over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10 and communication cost to 1/20.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on an exhaustive $Ω(n^2)$ pairwise comparison, inducing a dense representation that is impractical for large-scale permutations. To break this barrier, we introduce a novel framework for generating efficient permutation representations via kernel functions derived from sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from enumeration sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} , which leverages the divide-and-conquer structure of merge sort to produce a compact, $Θ(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity with no information loss and effectively capture permutation structure. Our central thesis is that the Merge Kernel performs competitively with the Mallows kernel in low-dimensional settings, but significantly outperforms it in both optimization performance and computational efficiency as the dimension $n$ grows. Extensive evaluations on various permutation optimization benchmarks confirm our hypothesis, demonstrating that the Merge Kernel provides a scalable and more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional permutation spaces, thereby unlocking the potential for tackling previously intractable problems such as large-scale feature ordering and combinatorial neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, submitted to ICLR-26</p></details> |

However, conventional approaches are insufficient in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors. These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family, RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Joint...</summary><p>Joint first authors: Shouren Mao and Minghao Qin.

Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE) dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours, outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing computation cost by 27%.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods.

However, much of the current research in MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules, or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a whole. Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model transferability across different data sources and robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods.

This approach thus relies on a significant manual effort by the quantum algorithm designer to design an appropriate circuit for the task. However this approach cannot scale to more complex quantum algorithms in the future without exponentially increasing the circuit design effort and introducing unwanted inductive biases. Motivated by this observation, we propose to automate the process of cicuit design by drawing inspiration from Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work, we propose two Quantum-NAS algorithms that aim to find efficient circuits given a particular quantum task. We choose quantum data compression as our driver quantum task and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by finding efficient autoencoder designs that outperform baselines on three different tasks - quantum data denoising, classical data compression and pure quantum data compression. Our results indicate that quantum NAS algorithms can significantly alleviate the manual effort while delivering performant quantum circuits for any given task.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[HyperNAS: Enhancing Architecture Representation for NAS Predictor via Hypernetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18151v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00174v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability. We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning. Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Llama-Nemotron: Efficient Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00949v5)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</p></details> |  |

| **[DART-ing Through the Drift: Dynamic Tracing of Knowledge Neurons for Adaptive Inference-Time Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22632v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial parameter redundancy, particularly in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/seeder-research/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Diffusion-Inspired Speculative Decoding for Fast LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19278v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework. Code is released at https://github.com/fvliang/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning Truncation for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01170v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised \textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTs: A Dual-Path Robust Framework for Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13735v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD) aims to accurately identify and localize complex abnormal patterns in the large-scale industrial control systems. While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components. Our code and model will be made publicly open soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Leveraging Multi-Agent Disagreement for Tool Recruitment in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07132v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/nsivaku/dart</p></details> |
| **[Darts Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14537v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we examine the effectiveness of five mathematical models used to predict the outcomes of amateur darts games. These models not only predict the outcomes at the start of the game, but also update their estimations as the game score changes. The models were trained and tested on a dataset consisting of games played by amateur players involving students, faculty, and staff at Roanoke College. The five models are: the null model, which is based only on the live scores, a logistic regression model, a basic simulation model, a time-adjusted simulation model, and a new variation of the Massey model which updates based on the current score. We evaluate these models using two approaches. First, we compare their Brier scores. Second, we conduct head-to-head comparisons in a betting game in which one model sets the betting odds while the other places bets. In both cases, model performance is assessed not only at the start of the game but also at the start of each round. Across both evaluation methods, the score-dependent Massey model performs the best. We conclude by illustrating how this score-dependent Massey model framework can be adapted to other competitive settings beyond darts.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[DART: A Structured Dataset of Regulatory Drug Documents in Italian for Clinical NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18475v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support. However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub: https://github.com/PRAISELab-PicusLab/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

We propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of 25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic, hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at International Conference on ICT Convergence 2025</p></details> |
| **[DART: Distilling Autoregressive Reasoning to Silent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11752v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant performance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without extra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05585v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART) framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

These models aim to learn generalizable representations of diverse DNA elements, potentially enabling various genomic prediction, interpretation and design tasks. Despite their potential, existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of DNALMs on key downstream applications involving an important class of non-coding DNA elements critical for regulating gene activity. In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources. We discuss potentially promising modeling, data curation, and evaluation strategies for the next generation of DNALMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2024</p></details> |

Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) > 20 and orbital period < 50 days.</p></details> | <details><summary>Numbe...</summary><p>Number of pages: 24, Number of figures: 8, Article accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal on 2025-05-30</p></details> |

State-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID, thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.</p></details> |  |

A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $ω^2$ where $ω$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces DART, a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT, that adapts its post-collision response by either engaging a locking mechanism for a rigid mode or disengaging it for a flexible mode, respectively. Comprehensive characterization tests highlight the significant difference in post collision responses between its rigid and flexible modes, with the rigid mode offering seven times higher stiffness compared to the flexible mode. To understand and harness the collision dynamics, we propose a novel collision response prediction model based on the linear complementarity system theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of predicting collision forces for both the rigid and flexible modes of DART. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the model and underscore its potential to advance collision-inclusive trajectory planning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches for radiology report generation have shown impressive performance. However, there remains significant potential to improve accuracy by ensuring that retrieved reports contain disease-relevant findings similar to those in the X-ray images and by refining generated reports. In this study, we propose a Disease-aware image-text Alignment and self-correcting Re-alignment for Trustworthy radiology report generation (DART) framework. In the first stage, we generate initial reports based on image-to-text retrieval with disease-matching, embedding both images and texts in a shared embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures the retrieval of reports with similar disease-relevant findings that closely align with the input X-ray images. In the second stage, we further enhance the initial reports by introducing a self-correction module that re-aligns them with the X-ray images. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, surpassing previous approaches in both report generation and clinical efficacy metrics, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of radiology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

However, current differentiable NAS methods often face constraints in efficiency, operation selection, and adaptability under varying resource limitations. We introduce ZO-DARTS++, a novel NAS method that effectively balances performance and resource constraints. By integrating a zeroth-order approximation for efficient gradient handling, employing a sparsemax function with temperature annealing for clearer and more interpretable architecture distributions, and adopting a size-variable search scheme for generating compact yet accurate architectures, ZO-DARTS++ establishes a new balance between model complexity and performance. In extensive tests on medical imaging datasets, ZO-DARTS++ improves the average accuracy by up to 1.8\% over standard DARTS-based methods and shortens search time by approximately 38.6\%. Additionally, its resource-constrained variants can reduce the number of parameters by more than 35\% while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Thus, ZO-DARTS++ offers a versatile and efficient framework for generating high-quality, resource-aware DL models suitable for real-world medical applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

This paper introduces DART-LLM, a novel framework that employs Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies, enabling the decomposition of natural language instructions into well-coordinated subtasks for multi-robot execution. DART-LLM comprises four key components: a Question-Answering (QA) LLM module for dependency-aware task decomposition, a Breakdown Function module for robot assignment, an Actuation module for execution, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detector for environmental perception, achieving end-to-end task execution. Experimental results across three task complexity levels demonstrate that DART-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming the baseline across all evaluation metrics. Among the tested models, DeepSeek-r1-671B achieves the highest success rate, whereas Llama-3.1-8B exhibits superior response time reliability. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit dependency modeling notably enhances the performance of smaller models, facilitating efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing models focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the origin of AIGT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

They are trained by denoising a Markovian process which gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |
| **[EM-DARTS: Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14432v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics has received increasing attention thanks to its highly secure identification. Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[DART-Math: Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning for Mathematical Problem-Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13690v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving mathematical problems requires advanced reasoning abilities and presents notable challenges for large language models. Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries. Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we propose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4. We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called DART-MATH. In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, DART-MATH outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.</p></details> | Preprint |

Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $α$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $β$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance.

However, conventional FL methods, particularly those following the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, utilize a central server for global aggregation, which exhibits limitations such as bottleneck and single point of failure. To address these issues, the Decentralized FL (DFL) paradigm has been proposed, which removes the client-server boundary and enables all participants to engage in model training and aggregation tasks. Nevertheless, as CFL, DFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably poisoning attacks that undermine model performance. While existing research on model robustness has predominantly focused on CFL, there is a noteworthy gap in understanding the model robustness of the DFL paradigm. In this paper, a thorough review of poisoning attacks targeting the model robustness in DFL systems, as well as their corresponding countermeasures, are presented. Additionally, a solution called DART is proposed to evaluate the robustness of DFL models, which is implemented and integrated into a DFL platform. Through extensive experiments, this paper compares the behavior of CFL and DFL under diverse poisoning attacks, pinpointing key factors affecting attack spread and effectiveness within the DFL. It also evaluates the performance of different defense mechanisms and investigates whether defense mechanisms designed for CFL are compatible with DFL. The empirical results provide insights into research challenges and suggest ways to improve the robustness of DFL models for future research.</p></details> |  |

We use this data-set to fit player skill models which can then be used in dynamic zero-sum games (ZSGs) that model real-world matches between players. We propose an empirical Bayesian approach based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) model that overcomes limitations in the data. Specifically we introduce two DM-based skill models where the first model borrows strength from other darts players and the second model borrows strength from other regions of the dartboard. We find these DM-based models outperform simpler benchmark models with respect to Brier and Spherical scores, both of which are proper scoring rules. We also show in ZSGs settings that the difference between DM-based skill models and the simpler benchmark models is practically significant. Finally, we use our DM-model to analyze specific situations that arose in real-world darts matches during the 2019 season.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.11031</p></details> |

Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter λ which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median λ in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with λ (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.</p></details> |  |

However, simulating realistic radar scans is a challenging task that requires an accurate model of the scene, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Rather than specifying these models explicitly, we propose DART - Doppler Aided Radar Tomography, a Neural Radiance Field-inspired method which uses radar-specific physics to create a reflectance and transmittance-based rendering pipeline for range-Doppler images. We then evaluate DART by constructing a custom data collection platform and collecting a novel radar dataset together with accurate position and instantaneous velocity measurements from lidar-based localization. In comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, DART synthesizes superior radar range-Doppler images from novel views across all datasets and additionally can be used to generate high quality tomographic images.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024; see https://wiselabcmu.github.io/dart/ for our project site</p></details> |

Nevertheless, achieving highly accurate background matting remains a formidable challenge, primarily owing to the limitations inherent in conventional RGB images. These limitations manifest in the form of susceptibility to varying lighting conditions and unforeseen shadows. In this paper, we leverage the rich depth information provided by the RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras to enhance background matting performance in real-time, dubbed DART. Firstly, we adapt the original RGB-based BGM algorithm to incorporate depth information. The resulting model's output undergoes refinement through Bayesian inference, incorporating a background depth prior. The posterior prediction is then translated into a "trimap," which is subsequently fed into a state-of-the-art matting algorithm to generate more precise alpha mattes. To ensure real-time matting capabilities, a critical requirement for many real-world applications, we distill the backbone of our model from a larger and more versatile BGM network. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Moreover, thanks to the distillation operation, our method achieves a remarkable processing speed of 33 frames per second (fps) on a mid-range edge-computing device. This high efficiency underscores DART's immense potential for deployment in mobile applications}</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: A Principled Approach to Adversarially Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11120v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts and adversarial examples are two major challenges for deploying machine learning models. While these challenges have been studied individually, their combination is an important topic that remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study the problem of adversarial robustness under a common setting of distribution shift - unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, given a labeled source domain $D_S$ and an unlabeled target domain $D_T$ with related but different distributions, the goal is to obtain an adversarially robust model for $D_T$. The absence of target domain labels poses a unique challenge, as conventional adversarial robustness defenses cannot be directly applied to $D_T$. To address this challenge, we first establish a generalization bound for the adversarial target loss, which consists of (i) terms related to the loss on the data, and (ii) a measure of worst-case domain divergence. Motivated by this bound, we develop a novel unified defense framework called Divergence Aware adveRsarial Training (DART), which can be used in conjunction with a variety of standard UDA methods; e.g., DANN [Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015]. DART is applicable to general threat models, including the popular $\ell_p$-norm model, and does not require heuristic regularizers or architectural changes. We also release DomainRobust: a testbed for evaluating robustness of UDA models to adversarial attacks. DomainRobust consists of 4 multi-domain benchmark datasets (with 46 source-target pairs) and 7 meta-algorithms with a total of 11 variants. Our large-scale experiments demonstrate that on average, DART significantly enhances model robustness on all benchmarks compared to the state of the art, while maintaining competitive standard accuracy. The relative improvement in robustness from DART reaches up to 29.2% on the source-target domain pairs considered.</p></details> |  |

This approach applies continuous relaxation of network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However, performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness. To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2024, paper + supplementary, 11 pages</p></details> |

CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>NOTE:...</summary><p>NOTE: This is an expanded version of a previously published conference paper.

| **[Word Sense Disambiguation as a Game of Neurosymbolic Darts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16663v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the hardest tasks in natural language understanding and knowledge engineering. The glass ceiling of 80% F1 score is recently achieved through supervised deep-learning, enriched by a variety of knowledge graphs. Here, we propose a novel neurosymbolic methodology that is able to push the F1 score above 90%. The core of our methodology is a neurosymbolic sense embedding, in terms of a configuration of nested balls in n-dimensional space. The centre point of a ball well-preserves word embedding, which partially fix the locations of balls. Inclusion relations among balls precisely encode symbolic hypernym relations among senses, and enable simple logic deduction among sense embeddings, which cannot be realised before. We trained a Transformer to learn the mapping from a contextualized word embedding to its sense ball embedding, just like playing the game of darts (a game of shooting darts into a dartboard). A series of experiments are conducted by utilizing pre-training n-ball embeddings, which have the coverage of around 70% training data and 75% testing data in the benchmark WSD corpus. The F1 scores in experiments range from 90.1% to 100.0% in all six groups of test data-sets (each group has 4 testing data with different sizes of n-ball embeddings). Our novel neurosymbolic methodology has the potential to break the ceiling of deep-learning approaches for WSD. Limitations and extensions of our current works are listed.</p></details> |  |

DARTS learns joint representations of two image distributions to enhance the content of low-resolution input images through matching correspondences learned from high-resolution reference images. Current state-of-the-art techniques in reference-based image super-resolution are based on a multi-network, multi-stage architecture. In this work, we adapt the double attention block from the GAN literature, processing the two visual streams separately and combining self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. Our work demonstrates how the attention mechanism can be adapted for the particular requirements of reference-based image super-resolution, significantly simplifying the architecture and training pipeline. We show that our transformer-based model performs competitively with state-of-the-art models, while maintaining a simpler overall architecture and training process. In particular, we obtain state-of-the-art on the SUN80 dataset, with a PSNR/SSIM of 29.83 / .809. These results show that attention alone is sufficient for the RSR task, without multiple purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training.</p></details> |  |

However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

We observe some recent studies already suffer from this issue that overshadows the meaning of scores. In this work, we first propose and orchestrate a suite of improvements to frame a larger and harder DSS, termed LHD, while retaining high efficiency in search. We step forward to renovate a LHD-based new benchmark, taking care of both discernibility and accessibility. Specifically, we re-implement twelve baselines and evaluate them across twelve conditions by combining two underexpolored influential factors: transductive robustness and discretization policy, to reasonably construct a benchmark upon multi-condition evaluation. Considering that the tabular benchmarks are always insufficient to adequately evaluate the methods of neural architecture search (NAS), our work can serve as a crucial basis for the future progress of NAS. https://github.com/chaoji90/LHD</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Common training strategies to improve generalization involve the use of data augmentations, ensembling and model averaging. In this work, we first establish a surprisingly simple but strong benchmark for generalization which utilizes diverse augmentations within a training minibatch, and show that this can learn a more balanced distribution of features. Further, we propose Diversify-Aggregate-Repeat Training (DART) strategy that first trains diverse models using different augmentations (or domains) to explore the loss basin, and further Aggregates their weights to combine their expertise and obtain improved generalization. We find that Repeating the step of Aggregation throughout training improves the overall optimization trajectory and also ensures that the individual models have a sufficiently low loss barrier to obtain improved generalization on combining them. We shed light on our approach by casting it in the framework proposed by Shen et al. and theoretically show that it indeed generalizes better. In addition to improvements in In- Domain generalization, we demonstrate SOTA performance on the Domain Generalization benchmarks in the popular DomainBed framework as well. Our method is generic and can easily be integrated with several base training algorithms to achieve performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

In this paper, we raise an interesting problem: can we properly measure the operation importance in DARTS through a training-free way, with avoiding the parameter-intensive bias? We investigate this question through the lens of edge connectivity, and provide an affirmative answer by defining a connectivity concept, ZERo-cost Operation Sensitivity (ZEROS), to score the importance of candidate operations in DARTS at initialization. By devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable architecture search (FreeDARTS). Based on the theory of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we show the proposed connectivity score provably negatively correlated with the generalization bound of DARTS supernet after convergence under gradient descent training. In addition, we theoretically explain how ZEROS implicitly avoids parameter-intensive bias in selecting architectures, and empirically show the searched architectures by FreeDARTS are of comparable size. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of search spaces, and results have demonstrated that FreeDARTS is a reliable and efficient baseline for neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised version with more theoretical analysis</p></details> |

Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS.

| **[$Λ$-DARTS: Mitigating Performance Collapse by Harmonizing Operation Selection among Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07998v2)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($Λ$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023</p></details> |
| **[$β$-DARTS++: Bi-level Regularization for Proxy-robust Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06393v1)** | 2023-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (i.e., $β$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $β$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $β$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665</p></details> |
| **[$α$ DARTS Once More: Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search by Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10105v1)** | 2022-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $α$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

It drastically reduces search cost by resorting to weight-sharing. However, it also dramatically reduces the search space, thus excluding potential promising architectures. In this article, we propose D-DARTS, a solution that addresses this problem by nesting neural networks at the cell level instead of using weight-sharing to produce more diversified and specialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we also present an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existing handcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch. This approach is accompanied by a novel metric that measures the distance between architectures inside our custom search space. Our solution reaches competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks.

Among different hand morphable models, MANO has been widely used in vision and graphics community. However, MANO disregards textures and accessories, which largely limits its power to synthesize photorealistic hand data. In this paper, we extend MANO with Diverse Accessories and Rich Textures, namely DART. DART is composed of 50 daily 3D accessories which varies in appearance and shape, and 325 hand-crafted 2D texture maps covers different kinds of blemishes or make-ups. Unity GUI is also provided to generate synthetic hand data with user-defined settings, e.g., pose, camera, background, lighting, textures, and accessories. Finally, we release DARTset, which contains large-scale (800K), high-fidelity synthetic hand images, paired with perfect-aligned 3D labels. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in diversity. As a complement to existing hand datasets, DARTset boosts the generalization in both hand pose estimation and mesh recovery tasks.

In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |

NAS has outperformed hand-designed networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task, leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked. Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search (DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better. Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average by 60%.</p></details> |  |

By adhering to 'Green AI' principles, the framework explicitly minimizes computational energy costs and carbon footprints, prioritizing sustainable deployment over raw computational scale. The Green-NAS architecture search method is optimized for both model accuracy and efficiency to find lightweight models with high accuracy and very few model parameters; this is accomplished through an optimization process that simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives. Our best-performing model, Green-NAS-A, achieved an RMSE of 0.0988 (i.e., within 1.4% of our manually tuned baseline) using only 153k model parameters, which is 239 times fewer than other globally applied weather forecasting models, such as GraphCast. In addition, we also describe how the use of transfer learning will improve the weather forecasting accuracy by approximately 5.2%, in comparison to a naive approach of training a new model for each city, when there is limited historical weather data available for that city.</p></details> |  |

However, the unique characteristics of sonar images, such as complex noise patterns and the lack of elevation information, pose significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. In this paper, we present NAS-GS, a novel Noise-Aware Sonar Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed to address these challenges. Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real-world large-scale offshore sonar scenarios, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

| **[LLM-NAS: LLM-driven Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01472v4)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose LLM-NAS: an LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed LLM-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, LLM-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches have relied on manually designed, complex network architectures to improve multi-scale feature extraction. However, such handcrafted models offer limited gains when prior knowledge is inadequate and are prone to overfitting on small datasets. In this paper, we introduce DeNAS-ViT, a data-efficient NAS-optimized Vision Transformer, the first method to leverage neural architecture search (NAS) for ultrasound image segmentation by automatically optimizing model architecture through token-level search. Specifically, we propose an efficient NAS module that performs multi-scale token search prior to the ViT's attention mechanism, effectively capturing both contextual and local features while minimizing computational costs. Given ultrasound's data scarcity and NAS's inherent data demands, we further develop a NAS-guided semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. This approach integrates network independence and contrastive learning within a stage-wise optimization strategy, significantly enhancing model robustness under limited-data conditions. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DeNAS-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness with minimal labeled data. Moreover, we highlight DeNAS-ViT's generalization potential beyond ultrasound imaging, underscoring its broader applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-26 Main Technical Track</p></details> |

Despite promising machine learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection. Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction, eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods, exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20725v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS) 2025</p></details> |

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods face critical limitations, including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction. CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its excellent generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional approaches are insufficient in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors. These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family, RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Joint...</summary><p>Joint first authors: Shouren Mao and Minghao Qin.

However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.</p></details> |  |

One of the key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$ search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity scenarios verify the flexibility.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure, especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead.

These models typically combine a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces \textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

To address this, Meta Neural Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones. Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines, achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.

To address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on accelerator-specific architecture.

However, the field faces two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed.

By utilizing an autoencoder that enforces an image similarity embedding in latent space, we construct an efficient kd-tree structure to order images by furthest neighbour dissimilarity in a low-dimensional embedding. From a given query image from our subsample dataset, we can identify the most dissimilar image within the global dataset in logarithmic time. Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of iterations required for convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 si...</summary><p>27 single-column pages, 8 figures, to be published in Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS.

Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters, 10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75% yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic within strict hardware limitations.</p></details> |  |

Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, Published on IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B) and Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B, two publicly available models derived from Llama-70B-Instruct. Both models achieve a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. These are the most accurate models supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing proxies are often suboptimal -- frequently outperformed by simple metrics like parameter count or FLOPs -- and they generalize poorly across different search spaces. Moreover, current model-based proxies struggle to adapt to new operators without access to ground-truth accuracy, limiting their transferability. We propose TG-NAS, a universal, model-based zero-cost (ZC) proxy that combines a Transformer-based operator embedding generator with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict architecture performance. Unlike prior model-based predictors, TG-NAS requires no retraining and generalizes across arbitrary search spaces. It serves as a standalone ZC proxy with strong data efficiency, robustness, and cross-space consistency. Extensive evaluations across diverse NAS benchmarks demonstrate TG-NAS's superior rank correlation and generalizability compared to existing proxies. Additionally, it improves search efficiency by up to 300x and discovers architectures achieving 93.75% CIFAR-10 accuracy on NAS-Bench-201 and 74.9% ImageNet top-1 accuracy on the DARTS space, establishing TG-NAS as a promising foundation for efficient, generalizable NAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidelines for the Quality Assessment of Energy-Aware NAS Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15631v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is increasingly large energy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.</p></details> |  |

Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sim-is-More: Randomizing HW-NAS with Synthetic Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00663v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing hardware-aware NAS (HW-NAS) methods typically assume access to precise information circa the target device, either via analytical approximations of the post-compilation latency model, or through learned latency predictors. Such approximate approaches risk introducing estimation errors that may prove detrimental in risk-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose a two-stage HW-NAS framework, in which we first learn an architecture controller on a distribution of synthetic devices, and then directly deploy the controller on a target device. At test-time, our network controller deploys directly to the target device without relying on any pre-collected information, and only exploits direct interactions. In particular, the pre-training phase on synthetic devices enables the controller to design an architecture for the target device by interacting with it through a small number of high-fidelity latency measurements. To guarantee accessibility of our method, we only train our controller with training-free accuracy proxies, allowing us to scale the meta-training phase without incurring the overhead of full network training. We benchmark on HW-NATS-Bench, demonstrating that our method generalizes to unseen devices and searches for latency-efficient architectures by in-context adaptation using only a few real-world latency evaluations at test-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[HW-NAS-Bench:Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10584v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. The codes and all collected data are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/HW-NAS-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2021 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Variation Matters: from Mitigating to Embracing Zero-Shot NAS Ranking Function Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19657v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful automatic alternative to manual design of a neural network. In the zero-shot version, a fast ranking function is used to compare architectures without training them. The outputs of the ranking functions often vary significantly due to different sources of randomness, including the evaluated architecture's weights' initialization or the batch of data used for calculations. A common approach to addressing the variation is to average a ranking function output over several evaluations. We propose taking into account the variation in a different manner, by viewing the ranking function output as a random variable representing a proxy performance metric. During the search process, we strive to construct a stochastic ordering of the performance metrics to determine the best architecture. Our experiments show that the proposed stochastic ordering can effectively boost performance of a search on standard benchmark search spaces.</p></details> |  |
