| **[DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.09055v2)** | 2019-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the scalability challenge of architecture search by formulating the task in a differentiable manner. Unlike conventional approaches of applying evolution or reinforcement learning over a discrete and non-differentiable search space, our method is based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, allowing efficient search of the architecture using gradient descent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels in discovering high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques. Our implementation has been made publicly available to facilitate further research on efficient architecture search algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2019; Code and pretrained models available at https://github.com/quark0/darts</p></details> |
| **[Cyclic Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10724v4)** | 2022-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search, i.e., DARTS, has drawn great attention in neural architecture search. It tries to find the optimal architecture in a shallow search network and then measures its performance in a deep evaluation network. The independent optimization of the search and evaluation networks, however, leaves room for potential improvement by allowing interaction between the two networks. To address the problematic optimization issue, we propose new joint optimization objectives and a novel Cyclic Differentiable ARchiTecture Search framework, dubbed CDARTS. Considering the structure difference, CDARTS builds a cyclic feedback mechanism between the search and evaluation networks with introspective distillation. First, the search network generates an initial architecture for evaluation, and the weights of the evaluation network are optimized. Second, the architecture weights in the search network are further optimized by the label supervision in classification, as well as the regularization from the evaluation network through feature distillation. Repeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and evaluation networks and thus enables the evolution of the architecture to fit the final evaluation network. The experiments and analysis on CIFAR, ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art ones. Specifically, in the DARTS search space, we achieve 97.52% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. In the chain-structured search space, we achieve 78.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 1.1% higher than EfficientNet-B0. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Cream.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |
| **[UNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search Meets Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07651v2)** | 2020-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to discover network architectures with desired properties such as high accuracy or low latency. Recently, differentiable NAS (DNAS) has demonstrated promising results while maintaining a search cost orders of magnitude lower than reinforcement learning (RL) based NAS. However, DNAS models can only optimize differentiable loss functions in search, and they require an accurate differentiable approximation of non-differentiable criteria. In this work, we present UNAS, a unified framework for NAS, that encapsulates recent DNAS and RL-based approaches under one framework. Our framework brings the best of both worlds, and it enables us to search for architectures with both differentiable and non-differentiable criteria in one unified framework while maintaining a low search cost. Further, we introduce a new objective function for search based on the generalization gap that prevents the selection of architectures prone to overfitting. We present extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets and we perform search in two fundamentally different search spaces. We show that UNAS obtains the state-of-the-art average accuracy on all three datasets when compared to the architectures searched in the DARTS space. Moreover, we show that UNAS can find an efficient and accurate architecture in the ProxylessNAS search space, that outperforms existing MobileNetV2 based architectures.

| **[DASViT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13079v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unchain the Search Space with Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04028v2)** | 2021-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DAS) has made great progress in searching for high-performance architectures with reduced computational cost. However, DAS-based methods mainly focus on searching for a repeatable cell structure, which is then stacked sequentially in multiple stages to form the networks. This configuration significantly reduces the search space, and ignores the importance of connections between the cells. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search (H-DAS) that performs architecture search both at the cell level and at the stage level. Specifically, the cell-level search space is relaxed so that the networks can learn stage-specific cell structures. For the stage-level search, we systematically study the architectures of stages, including the number of cells in each stage and the connections between the cells. Based on insightful observations, we design several search rules and losses, and mange to search for better stage-level architectures. Such hierarchical search space greatly improves the performance of the networks without introducing expensive search cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed H-DAS. Moreover, the searched stage-level architectures can be combined with the cell structures searched by existing DAS methods to further boost the performance.

| **[Differentially-private Federated Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10559v2)** | 2020-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search, which aims to automatically search for architectures (e.g., convolution, max pooling) of neural networks that maximize validation performance, has achieved remarkable progress recently. In many application scenarios, several parties would like to collaboratively search for a shared neural architecture by leveraging data from all parties. However, due to privacy concerns, no party wants its data to be seen by other parties. To address this problem, we propose federated neural architecture search (FNAS), where different parties collectively search for a differentiable architecture by exchanging gradients of architecture variables without exposing their data to other parties. To further preserve privacy, we study differentially-private FNAS (DP-FNAS), which adds random noise to the gradients of architecture variables. We provide theoretical guarantees of DP-FNAS in achieving differential privacy. Experiments show that DP-FNAS can search highly-performant neural architectures while protecting the privacy of individual parties. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/DP-FNAS</p></details> |  |
| **[Latency-Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06392v2)** | 2020-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search methods became popular in recent years, mainly due to their low search costs and flexibility in designing the search space. However, these methods suffer the difficulty in optimizing network, so that the searched network is often unfriendly to hardware. This paper deals with this problem by adding a differentiable latency loss term into optimization, so that the search process can tradeoff between accuracy and latency with a balancing coefficient. The core of latency prediction is to encode each network architecture and feed it into a multi-layer regressor, with the training data which can be easily collected from randomly sampling a number of architectures and evaluating them on the hardware. We evaluate our approach on NVIDIA Tesla-P100 GPUs. With 100K sampled architectures (requiring a few hours), the latency prediction module arrives at a relative error of lower than 10%. Equipped with this module, the search method can reduce the latency by 20% meanwhile preserving the accuracy. Our approach also enjoys the ability of being transplanted to a wide range of hardware platforms with very few efforts, or being used to optimizing other non-differentiable factors such as power consumption.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Differentiable Neural Architecture Search with Morphism-based Transformable Backbone Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07211v1)** | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims at making the architecture search process more adaptive for one-shot or online training. It is extended from the existing study on differentiable neural architecture search, and we made the backbone architecture transformable rather than fixed during the training process. As is known, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) requires a pre-defined over-parameterized backbone architecture, while its size is to be determined manually. Also, in DARTS backbone, Hadamard product of two elements is not introduced, which exists in both LSTM and GRU cells for recurrent nets. This study introduces a growing mechanism for differentiable neural architecture search based on network morphism. It enables growing of the cell structures from small size towards large size ones with one-shot training. Two modes can be applied in integrating the growing and original pruning process. We also implement a recently proposed two-input backbone architecture for recurrent neural networks. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach and the two-input backbone structure can be quite effective compared with other baseline architectures including LSTM, in a variety of learning tasks including multi-variate time series forecasting and language modeling. On the other hand, we find that dynamic network transformation is promising in improving the efficiency of differentiable architecture search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Architecture Search with Ensemble Gumbel-Softmax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01786v1)** | 2019-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For network architecture search (NAS), it is crucial but challenging to simultaneously guarantee both effectiveness and efficiency. Towards achieving this goal, we develop a differentiable NAS solution, where the search space includes arbitrary feed-forward network consisting of the predefined number of connections. Benefiting from a proposed ensemble Gumbel-Softmax estimator, our method optimizes both the architecture of a deep network and its parameters in the same round of backward propagation, yielding an end-to-end mechanism of searching network architectures. Extensive experiments on a variety of popular datasets strongly evidence that our method is capable of discovering high-performance architectures, while guaranteeing the requisite efficiency during searching.</p></details> |  |
| **[iDARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search with Stochastic Implicit Gradients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10784v1)** | 2021-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textit{Differentiable ARchiTecture Search} (DARTS) has recently become the mainstream of neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and simplicity. With a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path. To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming, with large margins, those learned by the baseline methods.</p></details> | ICML2021 |
| **[Making Differentiable Architecture Search less local](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10450v1)** | 2021-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a recent methodology for automating the design of neural network architectures. Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a promising NAS approach that dramatically increases search efficiency. However, it has been shown to suffer from performance collapse, where the search often leads to detrimental architectures. Many recent works try to address this issue of DARTS by identifying indicators for early stopping, regularising the search objective to reduce the dominance of some operations, or changing the parameterisation of the search problem. In this work, we hypothesise that performance collapses can arise from poor local optima around typical initial architectures and weights. We address this issue by developing a more global optimisation scheme that is able to better explore the space without changing the DARTS problem formulation. Our experiments show that our changes in the search algorithm allow the discovery of architectures with both better test performance and fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021 Workshop on Neural Architecture Search</p></details> |
| **[Differential Evolution for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06400v2)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) methods rely on a search strategy for deciding which architectures to evaluate next and a performance estimation strategy for assessing their performance (e.g., using full evaluations, multi-fidelity evaluations, or the one-shot model). In this paper, we focus on the search strategy. We introduce the simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm of differential evolution to the NAS community. Using the simplest performance evaluation strategy of full evaluations, we comprehensively compare this search strategy to regularized evolution and Bayesian optimization and demonstrate that it yields improved and more robust results for 13 tabular NAS benchmarks based on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-1Shot1, NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-HPO bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-level Optimization For Differential Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11337v1)** | 2020-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we point out that differential architecture search (DARTS) makes gradient of architecture parameters biased for network weights and architecture parameters are updated in different datasets alternatively in the bi-level optimization framework. The bias causes the architecture parameters of non-learnable operations to surpass that of learnable operations. Moreover, using softmax as architecture parameters' activation function and inappropriate learning rate would exacerbate the bias. As a result, it's frequently observed that non-learnable operations are dominated in the search phase. To reduce the bias, we propose to use single-level to replace bi-level optimization and non-competitive activation function like sigmoid to replace softmax. As a result, we could search high-performance architectures steadily. Experiments on NAS Benchmark 201 validate our hypothesis and stably find out nearly the optimal architecture. On DARTS space, we search the state-of-the-art architecture with 77.0% top1 accuracy (training setting follows PDARTS and without any additional module) on ImageNet-1K and steadily search architectures up-to 76.5% top1 accuracy (but not select the best from the searched architectures) which is comparable with current reported best result.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search Space Adaptation for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02098v1)** | 2022-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep neural networks achieve unprecedented performance in various tasks, neural architecture search (NAS), a research field for designing neural network architectures with automated processes, is actively underway. More recently, differentiable NAS has a great impact by reducing the search cost to the level of training a single network. Besides, the search space that defines candidate architectures to be searched directly affects the performance of the final architecture. In this paper, we propose an adaptation scheme of the search space by introducing a search scope. The effectiveness of proposed method is demonstrated with ProxylessNAS for the image classification task. Furthermore, we visualize the trajectory of architecture parameter updates and provide insights to improve the architecture search.</p></details> | 3 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Flexible Channel Dimensions for Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08021v1)** | 2023-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding optimal channel dimensions (i.e., the number of filters in DNN layers) is essential to design DNNs that perform well under computational resource constraints. Recent work in neural architecture search aims at automating the optimization of the DNN model implementation. However, existing neural architecture search methods for channel dimensions rely on fixed search spaces, which prevents achieving an efficient and fully automated solution. In this work, we propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search method with an efficient dynamic channel allocation algorithm to enable a flexible search space for channel dimensions. We show that the proposed framework is able to find DNN architectures that are equivalent to previous methods in task accuracy and inference latency for the CIFAR-10 dataset with an improvement of $1.3-1.7\times$ in GPU-hours and $1.5-1.7\times$ in the memory requirements during the architecture search stage. Moreover, the proposed frameworks do not require a well-engineered search space a priori, which is an important step towards fully automated design of DNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operation-level Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05632v1)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) is becoming more and more popular among Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods because of its high search efficiency and low compute cost. However, the stability of DARTS is very inferior, especially skip connections aggregation that leads to performance collapse. Though existing methods leverage Hessian eigenvalues to alleviate skip connections aggregation, they make DARTS unable to explore architectures with better performance. In the paper, we propose operation-level progressive differentiable neural architecture search (OPP-DARTS) to avoid skip connections aggregation and explore better architectures simultaneously. We first divide the search process into several stages during the search phase and increase candidate operations into the search space progressively at the beginning of each stage. It can effectively alleviate the unfair competition between operations during the search phase of DARTS by offsetting the inherent unfair advantage of the skip connection over other operations. Besides, to keep the competition between operations relatively fair and select the operation from the candidate operations set that makes training loss of the supernet largest. The experiment results indicate that our method is effective and efficient. Our method's performance on CIFAR-10 is superior to the architecture found by standard DARTS, and the transferability of our method also surpasses standard DARTS. We further demonstrate the robustness of our method on three simple search spaces, i.e., S2, S3, S4, and the results show us that our method is more robust than standard DARTS.

| **[D-DARTS: Distributed Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09306v6)** | 2022-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) is one of the most trending Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. It drastically reduces search cost by resorting to weight-sharing. However, it also dramatically reduces the search space, thus excluding potential promising architectures. In this article, we propose D-DARTS, a solution that addresses this problem by nesting neural networks at the cell level instead of using weight-sharing to produce more diversified and specialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we also present an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existing handcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch. This approach is accompanied by a novel metric that measures the distance between architectures inside our custom search space. Our solution reaches competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks.

| **[DSRNA: Differentiable Search of Robust Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06122v1)** | 2020-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep learning applications, the architectures of deep neural networks are crucial in achieving high accuracy. Many methods have been proposed to search for high-performance neural architectures automatically. However, these searched architectures are prone to adversarial attacks. A small perturbation of the input data can render the architecture to change prediction outcomes significantly. To address this problem, we propose methods to perform differentiable search of robust neural architectures. In our methods, two differentiable metrics are defined to measure architectures' robustness, based on certified lower bound and Jacobian norm bound. Then we search for robust architectures by maximizing the robustness metrics. Different from previous approaches which aim to improve architectures' robustness in an implicit way: performing adversarial training and injecting random noise, our methods explicitly and directly maximize robustness metrics to harvest robust architectures. On CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST, we perform game-based evaluation and verification-based evaluation on the robustness of our methods. The experimental results show that our methods 1) are more robust to various norm-bound attacks than several robust NAS baselines; 2) are more accurate than baselines when there are no attacks; 3) have significantly higher certified lower bounds than baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Scheduled Differentiable Architecture Search for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10236v1)** | 2019-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a capable class of models for visual recognition problems. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to develop generic and powerful network architectures, which requires significant efforts of human experts. In this paper, we introduce a new idea for automatically exploring architectures on a remould of Differentiable Architecture Search (DAS), which possesses the efficient search via gradient descent. Specifically, we present Scheduled Differentiable Architecture Search (SDAS) for both image and video recognition that nicely integrates the selection of operations during training with a schedule. Technically, an architecture or a cell is represented as a directed graph. Our SDAS gradually fixes the operations on the edges in the graph in a progressive and scheduled manner, as opposed to a one-step decision of operations for all the edges once the training completes in existing DAS, which may make the architecture brittle. Moreover, we enlarge the search space of SDAS particularly for video recognition by devising several unique operations to encode spatio-temporal dynamics and demonstrate the impact in affecting the architecture search of SDAS. Extensive experiments of architecture learning are conducted on CIFAR10, Kinetics10, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, and superior results are reported when comparing to DAS method. More remarkably, the search by our SDAS is around 2-fold faster than DAS. When transferring the learnt cells on CIFAR10 and Kinetics10 respectively to large-scale ImageNet and Kinetics400 datasets, the constructed network also outperforms several state-of-the-art hand-crafted structures.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces MorphNAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search framework designed to address these challenges. MorphNAS enhances Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by incorporating linguistic meta-features such as script type and morphological complexity to optimize neural architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It automatically identifies optimal micro-architectural elements tailored to language-specific morphology. By automating this search, MorphNAS aims to maximize the proficiency of multilingual NLP models, leading to improved comprehension and processing of these complex languages.</p></details> |  |

An example of neural architecture search, DARTS operates upon a continuous, differentiable search space which enables both the architecture and parameters to be optimised via gradient descent. Solutions based on partially-connected DARTS use random channel masking in the search space to reduce GPU time and automatically learn and optimise complex neural architectures composed of convolutional operations and residual blocks. Despite being learned quickly with little human effort, the resulting networks are competitive with the best performing systems reported in the literature. Some are also far less complex, containing 85% fewer parameters than a Res2Net competitor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2021</p></details> |
| **[EDAS: Efficient and Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01237v2)** | 2019-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transferrable neural architecture search can be viewed as a binary optimization problem where a single optimal path should be selected among candidate paths in each edge within the repeated cell block of the directed a cyclic graph form. Recently, the field of differentiable architecture search attempts to relax the search problem continuously using a one-shot network that combines all the candidate paths in search space. However, when the one-shot network is pruned to the model in the discrete architecture space by the derivation algorithm, performance is significantly degraded to an almost random estimator. To reduce the quantization error from the heavy use of relaxation, we only sample a single edge to relax the corresponding variable and clamp variables in the other edges to zero or one. By this method, there is no performance drop after pruning the one-shot network by derivation algorithm, due to the preservation of the discrete nature of optimization variables during the search. Furthermore, the minimization of relaxation degree allows searching in a deeper network to discover better performance with remarkable search cost reduction (0.125 GPU days) compared to previous methods. By adding several regularization methods that help explore within the search space, we could obtain the network with notable performances on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Robustifying Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09656v2)** | 2020-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted a lot of attention due to its simplicity and small search costs achieved by a continuous relaxation and an approximation of the resulting bi-level optimization problem. However, DARTS does not work robustly for new problems: we identify a wide range of search spaces for which DARTS yields degenerate architectures with very poor test performance. We study this failure mode and show that, while DARTS successfully minimizes validation loss, the found solutions generalize poorly when they coincide with high validation loss curvature in the architecture space. We show that by adding one of various types of regularization we can robustify DARTS to find solutions with less curvature and better generalization properties. Based on these observations, we propose several simple variations of DARTS that perform substantially more robustly in practice. Our observations are robust across five search spaces on three image classification tasks and also hold for the very different domains of disparity estimation (a dense regression task) and language modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>In: I...</summary><p>In: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020); 28 pages, 30 figures</p></details> |
| **[EM-DARTS: Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14432v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics has received increasing attention thanks to its highly secure identification. Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Towards Improving the Consistency, Efficiency, and Flexibility of Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11342v1)** | 2021-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most differentiable neural architecture search methods construct a super-net for search and derive a target-net as its sub-graph for evaluation. There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed of Engine-cells and Transit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. Besides, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. For experiments on CIFAR-10, our search on the standard space requires only 0.06 GPU-day. We further have an error rate of 2.22% with 0.07 GPU-day for the search on an extended space. We can also directly perform the search on ImageNet with topology learnable and achieve a top-1 error rate of 23.8% in 2.1 GPU-day.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search via Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05629v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a simple yet efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method. During the search stage, DARTS trains a supernet by jointly optimizing architecture parameters and network parameters. During the evaluation stage, DARTS discretizes the supernet to derive the optimal architecture based on architecture parameters. However, recent research has shown that during the training process, the supernet tends to converge towards sharp minima rather than flat minima. This is evidenced by the higher sharpness of the loss landscape of the supernet, which ultimately leads to a performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. In this paper, we propose Self-Distillation Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (SD-DARTS) to alleviate the discretization gap. We utilize self-distillation to distill knowledge from previous steps of the supernet to guide its training in the current step, effectively reducing the sharpness of the supernet's loss and bridging the performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of voting teachers, where multiple previous supernets are selected as teachers, and their output probabilities are aggregated through voting to obtain the final teacher prediction. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the advantages of our novel self-distillation-based NAS method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[Noisy Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03566v3)** | 2021-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has now become one of the mainstream paradigms of neural architecture search. However, it largely suffers from the well-known performance collapse issue due to the aggregation of skip connections. It is thought to have overly benefited from the residual structure which accelerates the information flow. To weaken this impact, we propose to inject unbiased random noise to impede the flow. We name this novel approach NoisyDARTS. In effect, a network optimizer should perceive this difficulty at each training step and refrain from overshooting, especially on skip connections. In the long run, since we add no bias to the gradient in terms of expectation, it is still likely to converge to the right solution area. We also prove that the injected noise plays a role in smoothing the loss landscape, which makes the optimization easier. Our method features extreme simplicity and acts as a new strong baseline. We perform extensive experiments across various search spaces, datasets, and tasks, where we robustly achieve state-of-the-art results.

| **[Adaptive Channel Allocation for Robust Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04681v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and significant improvement in efficiency. However, the excessive accumulation of the skip connection, when training epochs become large, makes it suffer from weak stability and low robustness, thus limiting its practical applications. Many works have attempted to restrict the accumulation of skip connections by indicators or manual design. These methods, however, are susceptible to human priors and hyper-parameters. In this work, we suggest a more subtle and direct approach that no longer explicitly searches for skip connections in the search stage, based on the paradox that skip connections were proposed to guarantee the performance of very deep networks, but the networks in the search stage of differentiable architecture search are actually very shallow. Instead, by introducing channel importance ranking and channel allocation strategy, the skip connections are implicitly searched and automatically refilled unimportant channels in the evaluation stage. Our method, dubbed Adaptive Channel Allocation (ACA) strategy, is a general-purpose approach for differentiable architecture search, which universally works in DARTS variants without introducing human priors, indicators, or hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets and DARTS variants verify that the ACA strategy is the most effective one among existing methods in improving robustness and dealing with the collapse issue when training epochs become large.</p></details> | Accepted by TNNLS |
| **[DAAS: Differentiable Architecture and Augmentation Policy Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15273v2)** | 2022-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has been an active direction of automatic machine learning (Auto-ML), aiming to explore efficient network structures. The searched architecture is evaluated by training on datasets with fixed data augmentation policies. However, recent works on auto-augmentation show that the suited augmentation policies can vary over different structures. Therefore, this work considers the possible coupling between neural architectures and data augmentation and proposes an effective algorithm jointly searching for them. Specifically, 1) for the NAS task, we adopt a single-path based differentiable method with Gumbel-softmax reparameterization strategy due to its memory efficiency; 2) for the auto-augmentation task, we introduce a novel search method based on policy gradient algorithm, which can significantly reduce the computation complexity. Our approach achieves 97.91% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 76.6% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset, showing the outstanding performance of our search algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Operation Importance for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10511v1)** | 2019-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, differentiable neural architecture search methods significantly reduce the search cost by constructing a super network and relax the architecture representation by assigning architecture weights to the candidate operations. All the existing methods determine the importance of each operation directly by architecture weights. However, architecture weights cannot accurately reflect the importance of each operation; that is, the operation with the highest weight might not related to the best performance. To alleviate this deficiency, we propose a simple yet effective solution to neural architecture search, termed as exploiting operation importance for effective neural architecture search (EoiNAS), in which a new indicator is proposed to fully exploit the operation importance and guide the model search. Based on this new indicator, we propose a gradual operation pruning strategy to further improve the search efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.50\% on CIFAR-10, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. When transferred to ImageNet, it achieves the top-1 error of 25.6\%, comparable to the state-of-the-art performance under the mobile setting.</p></details> |  |

However, our understanding of how to represent the search space for neural net architectures and how to search that space efficiently are both still in their infancy. We have performed an in-depth analysis to identify limitations in a widely used search space and a recent architecture search method, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). These findings led us to introduce novel network blocks with a more general, balanced, and consistent design; a better-optimized Cosine Power Annealing learning rate schedule; and other improvements. Our resulting sharpDARTS search is 50% faster with a 20-30% relative improvement in final model error on CIFAR-10 when compared to DARTS. Our best single model run has 1.93% (1.98+/-0.07) validation error on CIFAR-10 and 5.5% error (5.8+/-0.3) on the recently released CIFAR-10.1 test set. To our knowledge, both are state of the art for models of similar size. This model also generalizes competitively to ImageNet at 25.1% top-1 (7.8% top-5) error. We found improvements for existing search spaces but does DARTS generalize to new domains? We propose Differentiable Hyperparameter Grid Search and the HyperCuboid search space, which are representations designed to leverage DARTS for more general parameter optimization. Here we find that DARTS fails to generalize when compared against a human's one shot choice of models. We look back to the DARTS and sharpDARTS search spaces to understand why, and an ablation study reveals an unusual generalization gap. We finally propose Max-W regularization to solve this problem, which proves significantly better than the handmade design.

| **[Stabilizing Differentiable Architecture Search via Perturbation-based Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05283v3)** | 2021-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is a prevailing NAS solution to identify architectures. Based on the continuous relaxation of the architecture space, DARTS learns a differentiable architecture weight and largely reduces the search cost. However, its stability has been challenged for yielding deteriorating architectures as the search proceeds. We find that the precipitous validation loss landscape, which leads to a dramatic performance drop when distilling the final architecture, is an essential factor that causes instability. Based on this observation, we propose a perturbation-based regularization - SmoothDARTS (SDARTS), to smooth the loss landscape and improve the generalizability of DARTS-based methods. In particular, our new formulations stabilize DARTS-based methods by either random smoothing or adversarial attack. The search trajectory on NAS-Bench-1Shot1 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and due to the improved stability, we achieve performance gain across various search spaces on 4 datasets. Furthermore, we mathematically show that SDARTS implicitly regularizes the Hessian norm of the validation loss, which accounts for a smoother loss landscape and improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2020, code is available at https://github.com/xiangning-chen/SmoothDARTS</p></details> |

However, the inherent complexity of designing TinyML systems hampers their broad adoption. To reduce this complexity, we introduce "Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search". Unlike conventional Differentiable Neural Architecture Search, our approach expands the search space to include data configuration parameters alongside architectural choices. This enables Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to co-optimize model architecture and input data characteristics, effectively balancing resource usage and system performance for TinyML applications. Initial results on keyword spotting demonstrate that this novel approach to TinyML system design can generate lean but highly accurate systems.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches often report lower accuracy in evaluating the searched architecture or transferring it to another dataset. This is arguably due to the large gap between the architecture depths in search and evaluation scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm which allows the depth of searched architectures to grow gradually during the training procedure. This brings two issues, namely, heavier computational overheads and weaker search stability, which we solve using search space approximation and regularization, respectively. With a significantly reduced search time (~7 hours on a single GPU), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10 or CIFAR100) and the target dataset (ImageNet).

One technique missing from incremental learning is automatic architecture design via Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we show that leveraging NAS for incremental learning results in strong performance gains for classification tasks. Specifically, we contribute the following: first, we create a strong baseline approach for incremental learning based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) and state-of-the-art incremental learning strategies, outperforming many existing strategies trained with similar-sized popular architectures; second, we extend the idea of architecture search to regularize architecture forgetting, boosting performance past our proposed baseline. We evaluate our method on both RF signal and image classification tasks, and demonstrate we can achieve up to a 10% performance increase over state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, our contribution enables learning from continuous distributions on real-world application data for which the complexity of the data distribution is unknown, or the modality less explored (such as RF signal classification).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2022)</p></details> |

We note that DNNs must be executed under strictly hard performance constraints in real-world scenarios, for example, the runtime latency on autonomous vehicles. However, to obtain the architecture that meets the given performance constraint, previous hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search runs to manually tune the hyper-parameters by trial and error, and thus the total design cost increases proportionally. To resolve this, we introduce a lightweight hardware-aware differentiable NAS framework dubbed LightNAS, striving to find the required architecture that satisfies various performance constraints through a one-time search (i.e., \underline{\textit{you only search once}}). Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of LightNAS over previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2022</p></details> |

However, more recent works find that existing differentiable NAS techniques struggle to outperform naive baselines, yielding deteriorative architectures as the search proceeds. Rather than directly optimizing the architecture parameters, this paper formulates the neural architecture search as a distribution learning problem through relaxing the architecture weights into Gaussian distributions. By leveraging the natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI), the architecture distribution can be easily optimized based on existing codebases without incurring more memory and computational consumption. We demonstrate how the differentiable NAS benefits from Bayesian principles, enhancing exploration and improving stability. The experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmark datasets confirm the significant improvements the proposed framework can make. In addition, instead of simply applying the argmax on the learned parameters, we further leverage the recently-proposed training-free proxies in NAS to select the optimal architecture from a group architectures drawn from the optimized distribution, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmarks. Our best architecture in the DARTS search space also obtains competitive test errors with 2.37\%, 15.72\%, and 24.2\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, directly using DARTS for Transformers is memory-intensive, which renders the search process infeasible. To this end, we propose a multi-split reversible network and combine it with DARTS. Specifically, we devise a backpropagation-with-reconstruction algorithm so that we only need to store the last layer's outputs. By relieving the memory burden for DARTS, it allows us to search with larger hidden size and more candidate operations. We evaluate the searched architecture on three sequence-to-sequence datasets, i.e., WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French, and WMT'14 English-Czech. Experimental results show that our network consistently outperforms standard Transformers across the tasks. Moreover, our method compares favorably with big-size Evolved Transformers, reducing search computation by an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2021</p></details> |

The intrinsic problem complexity poses the challenge to enhance the performance of generative networks. In this work, we aim to boost model learning from the perspective of network architectures, by incorporating recent progress on automated architecture search into GANs. To this end, we propose a fully differentiable search framework for generative adversarial networks, dubbed alphaGAN. The searching process is formalized as solving a bi-level minimax optimization problem, in which the outer-level objective aims for seeking a suitable network architecture towards pure Nash Equilibrium conditioned on the generator and the discriminator network parameters optimized with a traditional GAN loss in the inner level. The entire optimization performs a first-order method by alternately minimizing the two-level objective in a fully differentiable manner, enabling architecture search to be completed in an enormous search space. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets show that our algorithm can obtain high-performing architectures only with 3-GPU hours on a single GPU in the search space comprised of approximate 2 ? 1011 possible configurations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis on the behavior of the searching process and the properties of searched architectures, which would benefit further research on architectures for generative models.

Multi-path framework (e.g. DARTS) is intuitive but suffers from memory usage and training collapse. Single-path methods (e.g.GDAS and ProxylessNAS) mitigate the memory issue and shrink the gap between searching and evaluation but sacrifice the performance. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple yet efficient method to bridge these two paradigms, referred as Mutually-aware Sub-Graphs Differentiable Architecture Search (MSG-DAS). The core of our framework is a differentiable Gumbel-TopK sampler that produces multiple mutually exclusive single-path sub-graphs. To alleviate the severer skip-connect issue brought by multiple sub-graphs setting, we propose a Dropblock-Identity module to stabilize the optimization. To make best use of the available models (super-net and sub-graphs), we introduce a memory-efficient super-net guidance distillation to improve training. The proposed framework strikes a balance between flexible memory usage and searching quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on ImageNet and CIFAR10, where the searched models show a comparable performance as the most recent approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00171v1)** | 2021-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms like DARTS, the training set used to update model weight and the validation set used to update model architectures are sampled from the same data distribution. Thus, the uncommon features in the dataset fail to receive enough attention during training. In this paper, instead of introducing more complex NAS algorithms, we explore the idea that adding quality synthesized datasets into training can help the classification model identify its weakness and improve recognition accuracy. We introduce a training strategy called ``Differentiable Architecture Search with a Generative Model(DASGM)." In DASGM, the training set is used to update the classification model weight, while a synthesized dataset is used to train its architecture. The generated images have different distributions from the training set, which can help the classification model learn better features to identify its weakness. We formulate DASGM into a multi-level optimization framework and develop an effective algorithm to solve it. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet have demonstrated the effectiveness of DASGM. Code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 12 figures</p></details> |

Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</p></details> |  |
| **[DOTS: Decoupling Operation and Topology in Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00969v3)** | 2021-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted extensive attention due to its efficiency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that the architecture of DNNs has a significant impact on model utility in the context of private deep learning, whereas its effect is largely unexplored in previous studies. In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, we delicately design a novel search space and propose a DP-aware method for training candidate models. We empirically certify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The searched model DPNASNet achieves state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs, e.g., for the privacy budget of $(ε, δ)=(3, 1\times10^{-5})$, our model obtains test accuracy of $98.57\%$ on MNIST, $88.09\%$ on FashionMNIST, and $68.33\%$ on CIFAR-10. Furthermore, by studying the generated architectures, we provide several intriguing findings of designing private-learning-friendly DNNs, which can shed new light on model design for deep learning with differential privacy.</p></details> |  |

However, the searched architectures are usually suboptimal in accuracy and may have large jitters around the target latency. In this paper, we rethink three freedoms of differentiable NAS, i.e. operation-level, depth-level and width-level, and propose a novel method, named Three-Freedom NAS (TF-NAS), to achieve both good classification accuracy and precise latency constraint. For the operation-level, we present a bi-sampling search algorithm to moderate the operation collapse. For the depth-level, we introduce a sink-connecting search space to ensure the mutual exclusion between skip and other candidate operations, as well as eliminate the architecture redundancy. For the width-level, we propose an elasticity-scaling strategy that achieves precise latency constraint in a progressively fine-grained manner.

From this perspective, we introduce a novel \textit{perturbation-based zero-cost operation scoring} (Zero-Cost-PT) approach, which utilizes zero-cost proxies that were recently studied in multi-trial NAS but degrade significantly on larger search spaces, typical for differentiable NAS.

| **[DARTS+: Improved Differentiable Architecture Search with Early Stopping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06035v2)** | 2020-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automating the process of neural architecture design, and the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method makes the process available within a few GPU days. However, the performance of DARTS is often observed to collapse when the number of search epochs becomes large. Meanwhile, lots of "{\em skip-connect}s" are found in the selected architectures. In this paper, we claim that the cause of the collapse is that there exists overfitting in the optimization of DARTS. Therefore, we propose a simple and effective algorithm, named "DARTS+", to avoid the collapse and improve the original DARTS, by "early stopping" the search procedure when meeting a certain criterion. We also conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and different search spaces and show the effectiveness of our DARTS+ algorithm, and DARTS+ achieves $2.32\%$ test error on CIFAR10, $14.87\%$ on CIFAR100, and $23.7\%$ on ImageNet. We further remark that the idea of "early stopping" is implicitly included in some existing DARTS variants by manually setting a small number of search epochs, while we give an {\em explicit} criterion for "early stopping".</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the wiring evolution in differentiable neural architecture search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01272v4)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controversy exists on whether differentiable neural architecture search methods discover wiring topology effectively. To understand how wiring topology evolves, we study the underlying mechanism of several existing differentiable NAS frameworks. Our investigation is motivated by three observed searching patterns of differentiable NAS: 1) they search by growing instead of pruning; 2) wider networks are more preferred than deeper ones; 3) no edges are selected in bi-level optimization. To anatomize these phenomena, we propose a unified view on searching algorithms of existing frameworks, transferring the global optimization to local cost minimization. Based on this reformulation, we conduct empirical and theoretical analyses, revealing implicit inductive biases in the cost's assignment mechanism and evolution dynamics that cause the observed phenomena. These biases indicate strong discrimination towards certain topologies. To this end, we pose questions that future differentiable methods for neural wiring discovery need to confront, hoping to evoke a discussion and rethinking on how much bias has been enforced implicitly in existing NAS methods.</p></details> | AISTATS 2021 |
| **[$β$-DARTS: Beta-Decay Regularization for Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01665v2)** | 2022-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search~(NAS) has attracted increasingly more attention in recent years because of its capability to design deep neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they suffer from two main issues, the weak robustness to the performance collapse and the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures. To solve these two problems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from too large. Furthermore, we provide in-depth theoretical analysis on how it works and why it works. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-201 show that our proposed method can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. In addition, our search scheme shows an outstanding property of being less dependent on training time and data. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | CVPR2022 |
| **[Differentiable architecture search with multi-dimensional attention for spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00902v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained enormous popularity in the field of artificial intelligence due to their low power consumption. However, the majority of SNN methods directly inherit the structure of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), usually leading to sub-optimal model performance in SNNs. To alleviate this problem, we integrate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method and propose Multi-Attention Differentiable Architecture Search (MA-DARTS) to directly automate the search for the optimal network structure of SNNs. Initially, we defined a differentiable two-level search space and conducted experiments within micro architecture under a fixed layer. Then, we incorporated a multi-dimensional attention mechanism and implemented the MA-DARTS algorithm in this search space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification compared to other methods under the same parameters with 94.40% accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset and 76.52% accuracy on CIFAR100 dataset. Additionally, we monitored and assessed the number of spikes (NoS) in each cell during the whole experiment. Notably, the number of spikes of the whole model stabilized at approximately 110K in validation and 100k in training on datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory-Inspired Path-Regularized Differential Network Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16537v2)** | 2020-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its high search efficiency, differential architecture search (DARTS) often selects network architectures with dominated skip connections which lead to performance degradation. However, theoretical understandings on this issue remain absent, hindering the development of more advanced methods in a principled way. In this work, we solve this problem by theoretically analyzing the effects of various types of operations, e.g. convolution, skip connection and zero operation, to the network optimization. We prove that the architectures with more skip connections can converge faster than the other candidates, and thus are selected by DARTS. This result, for the first time, theoretically and explicitly reveals the impact of skip connections to fast network optimization and its competitive advantage over other types of operations in DARTS. Then we propose a theory-inspired path-regularized DARTS that consists of two key modules: (i) a differential group-structured sparse binary gate introduced for each operation to avoid unfair competition among operations, and (ii) a path-depth-wise regularization used to incite search exploration for deep architectures that often converge slower than shallow ones as shown in our theory and are not well explored during the search. Experimental results on image classification tasks validate its advantages.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2020 (oral) |

In this paper, we consider the one-shot NAS problem for resource constrained applications. This problem is of great interest because it is critical to choose different architectures according to task complexity when the resource is constrained. Previous techniques are either too slow for one-shot learning or does not take the resource constraint into consideration. In this paper, we propose the resource constrained differentiable architecture search (RC-DARTS) method to learn architectures that are significantly smaller and faster while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we propose to formulate the RC-DARTS task as a constrained optimization problem by adding the resource constraint. An iterative projection method is proposed to solve the given constrained optimization problem. We also propose a multi-level search strategy to enable layers at different depths to adaptively learn different types of neural architectures. Through extensive experiments on the Cifar10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that the RC-DARTS method learns lightweight neural architectures which have smaller model size and lower computational complexity while achieving comparable or better performances than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Tech report |

However, it suffers from well-known performance collapse due to an inevitable aggregation of skip connections. In this paper, we first disclose that its root cause lies in an unfair advantage in exclusive competition. Through experiments, we show that if either of two conditions is broken, the collapse disappears. Thereby, we present a novel approach called Fair DARTS where the exclusive competition is relaxed to be collaborative. Specifically, we let each operation's architectural weight be independent of others. Yet there is still an important issue of discretization discrepancy. We then propose a zero-one loss to push architectural weights towards zero or one, which approximates an expected multi-hot solution. Our experiments are performed on two mainstream search spaces, and we derive new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

| **[Partial Connection Based on Channel Attention for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00791v1)** | 2022-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS), as a gradient-guided search method, greatly reduces the cost of computation and speeds up the search. In DARTS, the architecture parameters are introduced to the candidate operations, but the parameters of some weight-equipped operations may not be trained well in the initial stage, which causes unfair competition between candidate operations. The weight-free operations appear in large numbers which results in the phenomenon of performance crash. Besides, a lot of memory will be occupied during training supernet which causes the memory utilization to be low. In this paper, a partial channel connection based on channel attention for differentiable neural architecture search (ADARTS) is proposed. Some channels with higher weights are selected through the attention mechanism and sent into the operation space while the other channels are directly contacted with the processed channels. Selecting a few channels with higher attention weights can better transmit important feature information into the search space and greatly improve search efficiency and memory utilization. The instability of network structure caused by random selection can also be avoided. The experimental results show that ADARTS achieved 2.46% and 17.06% classification error rates on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. ADARTS can effectively solve the problem that too many skip connections appear in the search process and obtain network structures with better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures Y.

It is however challenging to design models that have both high accuracy and low latency for accurate and fast responsiveness. Many efforts have been made to develop end-to-end neural networks, in which depthwise separable convolutions, temporal convolutions, and LSTMs are adopted as building units. Nonetheless, these networks designed with human expertise may not achieve an optimal trade-off in an expansive search space. In this paper, we propose to leverage recent advances in differentiable neural architecture search to discover more efficient networks.

The main benefit of DAS is the effectiveness achieved through the weight-sharing one-shot paradigm, which allows efficient architecture search. In this work, we investigate DAS in a systematic case study of inverse problems, which allows us to analyze these potential benefits in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the success of DAS can be extended from image classification to signal reconstruction, in principle. However, our experiments also expose three fundamental difficulties in the evaluation of DAS-based methods in inverse problems: First, the results show a large variance in all test cases. Second, the final performance is strongly dependent on the hyperparameters of the optimizer. And third, the performance of the weight-sharing architecture used during training does not reflect the final performance of the found architecture well. While the results on image reconstruction confirm the potential of the DAS paradigm, they challenge the common understanding of DAS as a one-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

However, existing text-based NAS neither performs a learnable fusion of neural operations to optimize the architecture, nor encodes the latent hierarchical categorization behind text input. This paper presents a novel NAS method, Discretized Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DDNAS), for text representation learning and classification. With the continuous relaxation of architecture representation, DDNAS can use gradient descent to optimize the search. We also propose a novel discretization layer via mutual information maximization, which is imposed on every search node to model the latent hierarchical categorization in text representation. Extensive experiments conducted on eight diverse real datasets exhibit that DDNAS can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art NAS methods. While DDNAS relies on only three basic operations, i.e., convolution, pooling, and none, to be the candidates of NAS building blocks, its promising performance is noticeable and extensible to obtain further improvement by adding more different operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Trans.

In this work we resolve this by introducing Hard Constrained diffeRentiable NAS (HardCoRe-NAS), that is based on an accurate formulation of the expected resource requirement and a scalable search method that satisfies the hard constraint throughout the search.

It has attracted significant attentions in Auto-ML research and becomes one of the most useful paradigms in NAS. Although DARTS can produce superior efficiency over traditional NAS approaches with better control of complex parameters, oftentimes it suffers from stabilization issues in producing deteriorating architectures when discretizing the continuous architecture. We observed considerable loss of validity causing dramatic decline in performance at this final discretization step of DARTS. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Shift based DARTS (MS-DARTS) to improve stability based on sampling and perturbation. Our approach can improve bot the stability and accuracy of DARTS, by smoothing the loss landscape and sampling architecture parameters within a suitable bandwidth. We investigate the convergence of our mean-shift approach, together with the effects of bandwidth selection that affects stability and accuracy. Evaluations performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that MS-DARTS archives higher performance over other state-of-the-art NAS methods with reduced search cost.</p></details> | 14pages |

In this work, we present ApproxDARTS, a neural architecture search (NAS) method enabling the popular differentiable neural architecture search method called DARTS to exploit approximate multipliers and thus reduce the power consumption of generated neural networks. We showed on the CIFAR-10 data set that the ApproxDARTS is able to perform a complete architecture search within less than $10$ GPU hours and produce competitive convolutional neural networks (CNN) containing approximate multipliers in convolutional layers. For example, ApproxDARTS created a CNN showing an energy consumption reduction of (a) $53.84\%$ in the arithmetic operations of the inference phase compared to the CNN utilizing the native $32$-bit floating-point multipliers and (b) $5.97\%$ compared to the CNN utilizing the exact $8$-bit fixed-point multipliers, in both cases with a negligible accuracy drop.

| **[Heart-Darts: Classification of Heartbeats Using Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00693v1)** | 2021-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arrhythmia is a cardiovascular disease that manifests irregular heartbeats. In arrhythmia detection, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an important diagnostic technique. However, manually evaluating ECG signals is a complicated and time-consuming task. With the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the evaluation process has been accelerated and the performance is improved. It is noteworthy that the performance of CNNs heavily depends on their architecture design, which is a complex process grounded on expert experience and trial-and-error. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Heart-Darts, to efficiently classify the ECG signals by automatically designing the CNN model with the differentiable architecture search (i.e., Darts, a cell-based neural architecture search method). Specifically, we initially search a cell architecture by Darts and then customize a novel CNN model for ECG classification based on the obtained cells. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed method, we evaluate the constructed model on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Additionally, the extensibility of the proposed CNN model is validated on two other new databases. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art CNN models in ECG classification in terms of both performance and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Temperature is All You Need for Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06855v1)** | 2023-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) yields highly efficient gradient-based neural architecture search (NAS) by relaxing the discrete operation selection to optimize continuous architecture parameters that maps NAS from the discrete optimization to a continuous problem. DARTS then remaps the relaxed supernet back to the discrete space by one-off post-search pruning to obtain the final architecture (finalnet). Some emerging works argue that this remap is inherently prone to mismatch the network between training and evaluation which leads to performance discrepancy and even model collapse in extreme cases. We propose to close the gap between the relaxed supernet in training and the pruned finalnet in evaluation through utilizing small temperature to sparsify the continuous distribution in the training phase. To this end, we first formulate sparse-noisy softmax to get around gradient saturation. We then propose an exponential temperature schedule to better control the outbound distribution and elaborate an entropy-based adaptive scheme to finally achieve the enhancement. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficiency and efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for PAKDD 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we make efforts to alleviate the performance collapse problem for DARTS from two aspects. First, we investigate the expressive power of the supernet in DARTS and then derive a new setup of DARTS paradigm with only training BatchNorm. Second, we theoretically find that random features dilute the auxiliary connection role of skip-connection in supernet optimization and enable search algorithm focus on fairer operation selection, thereby solving the performance collapse problem. We instantiate DARTS and PC-DARTS with random features to build an improved version for each named RF-DARTS and RF-PCDARTS respectively. Experimental results show that RF-DARTS obtains \textbf{94.36\%} test accuracy on CIFAR-10 (which is the nearest optimal result in NAS-Bench-201), and achieves the newest state-of-the-art top-1 test error of \textbf{24.0\%} on ImageNet when transferring from CIFAR-10. Moreover, RF-DARTS performs robustly across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN) and four search spaces (S1-S4). Besides, RF-PCDARTS achieves even better results on ImageNet, that is, \textbf{23.9\%} top-1 and \textbf{7.1\%} top-5 test error, surpassing representative methods like single-path, training-free, and partial-channel paradigms directly searched on ImageNet.</p></details> | Tech Report |

We first employ a series of exploratory experiments to verify that neither high-strength architecture parameters regularization nor warmup training scheme can effectively solve this problem. Based on the insights from the experiments, we conjecture that the performance of DARTS does not depend on the well-trained supernet weights and argue that the architecture parameters should be trained by the gradients which are obtained in the early stage rather than the final stage of training. This argument is then verified by exchanging the learning rate schemes of weights and parameters. Experimental results show that the simple swap of the learning rates can effectively solve the degradation and achieve competitive performance. Further empirical evidence suggests that the degradation is not a simple problem of the validation set overfitting but exhibit some links between the degradation and the operation selection bias within bilevel optimization dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of this bias and propose to utilize this bias to achieve an operation-magnitude-based selective stop.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at the CIKM 2021 conference</p></details> |

Recently, DARTS relaxes the search process with a differentiable formulation that leverages weight-sharing and SGD where all candidate operations are trained simultaneously. Our empirical results show that such procedure results in the co-adaption problem and Matthew Effect: operations with fewer parameters would be trained maturely earlier. This causes two problems: firstly, the operations with more parameters may never have the chance to express the desired function since those with less have already done the job; secondly, the system will punish those underperforming operations by lowering their architecture parameter, and they will get smaller loss gradients, which causes the Matthew Effect. In this paper, we systematically study these problems and propose a novel grouped operation dropout algorithm named DropNAS to fix the problems with DARTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DropNAS solves the above issues and achieves promising performance. Specifically, DropNAS achieves 2.26% test error on CIFAR-10, 16.39% on CIFAR-100 and 23.4% on ImageNet (with the same training hyperparameters as DARTS for a fair comparison). It is also observed that DropNAS is robust across variants of the DARTS search space. Code is available at https://github.com/wiljohnhong/DropNAS.</p></details> |  |

Not surprisingly, the manual design process becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior experience, enormous effort, intuition, and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile, neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism with early stopping to automate the network design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the objective of Siamese tracking networks during offline training. Besides, the proposed early stopping strategy avoids over-fitting and performance collapse problems leading to generalization improvement. The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to construct a network.

While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we are the first to propose a fully simultaneous, efficient differentiable DNN architecture and implementation co-search (EDD) methodology. We formulate the co-search problem by fusing DNN search variables and hardware implementation variables into one solution space, and maximize both algorithm accuracy and hardware implementation quality.

The formulation is also applicable for various devices with different objectives. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our EDD methodology by searching for three representative DNNs, targeting low-latency GPU implementation and FPGA implementations with both recursive and pipelined architectures.

Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

People used it to address error mitigation, unitary decomposition, and quantum approximation optimization problems based on fixed datasets. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is a part of quantum machine learning and often has various data. QRL usually uses a manually designed circuit. However, the pre-defined circuit needs more flexibility for different tasks, and the circuit design based on various datasets could become intractable in the case of a large circuit. The problem of whether DQAS can be applied to quantum deep Q-learning with various datasets is still open. The main target of this work is to discover the capability of DQAS to solve quantum deep Q-learning problems. We apply a gradient-based framework DQAS on reinforcement learning tasks and evaluate it in two different environments - cart pole and frozen lake. It contains input- and output weights, progressive search, and other new features. The experiments conclude that DQAS can design quantum circuits automatically and efficiently. The evaluation results show significant outperformance compared to the manually designed circuit. Furthermore, the performance of the automatically created circuit depends on whether the super-circuit learned well during the training process. This work is the first to show that gradient-based quantum architecture search is applicable to QRL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 pages, 3 figures, QCE23 workshop QML</p></details> |

However, DARTS-based DNAS's search space is small when compared to other search methods', since all candidate network layers must be explicitly instantiated in memory. To address this bottleneck, we propose a memory and computationally efficient DNAS variant: DMaskingNAS. This algorithm expands the search space by up to $10^{14}\times$ over conventional DNAS, supporting searches over spatial and channel dimensions that are otherwise prohibitively expensive: input resolution and number of filters. We propose a masking mechanism for feature map reuse, so that memory and computational costs stay nearly constant as the search space expands. Furthermore, we employ effective shape propagation to maximize per-FLOP or per-parameter accuracy. The searched FBNetV2s yield state-of-the-art performance when compared with all previous architectures. With up to 421$\times$ less search cost, DMaskingNAS finds models with 0.9% higher accuracy, 15% fewer FLOPs than MobileNetV3-Small; and with similar accuracy but 20% fewer FLOPs than Efficient-B0. Furthermore, our FBNetV2 outperforms MobileNetV3 by 2.6% in accuracy, with equivalent model size. FBNetV2 models are open-sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/mobile-vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, accepted to CVPR 2020</p></details> |
| **[Mixed Precision Quantization of ConvNets via Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00090v1)** | 2018-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in network quantization has substantially reduced the time and space complexity of neural network inference, enabling their deployment on embedded and mobile devices with limited computational and memory resources. However, existing quantization methods often represent all weights and activations with the same precision (bit-width). In this paper, we explore a new dimension of the design space: quantizing different layers with different bit-widths. We formulate this problem as a neural architecture search problem and propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to efficiently explore its exponential search space with gradient-based optimization. Experiments show we surpass the state-of-the-art compression of ResNet on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our quantized models with 21.1x smaller model size or 103.9x lower computational cost can still outperform baseline quantized or even full precision models.</p></details> |  |
| **[$β$-DARTS++: Bi-level Regularization for Proxy-robust Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06393v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (i.e., $β$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $β$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $β$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Through Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14402v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical enabler of emotion-aware communication in human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have substantially enhanced the performance of SER models through increased model complexity. However, designing optimal DL architectures requires prior experience and experimental evaluations. Encouragingly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a promising avenue to determine an optimal DL model automatically. In particular, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient method of using NAS to search for optimised models. This paper proposes a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and LSTM architecture, to improve SER performance, where the literature informs the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to offer improved performance. While DARTS has previously been applied to CNN and LSTM combinations, our approach introduces a novel mechanism, particularly in selecting CNN operations using DARTS. In contrast to previous studies, we refrain from imposing constraints on the order of the layers for the CNN within the DARTS cell; instead, we allow DARTS to determine the optimal layer order autonomously. Experimenting with the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significantly higher SER accuracy than hand-engineering the CNN-LSTM configuration. It also outperforms the best-reported SER results achieved using DARTS on CNN-LSTM.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MSR-DARTS: Minimum Stable Rank of Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09209v2)** | 2021-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In neural architecture search (NAS), differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has recently attracted much attention due to its high efficiency. It defines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which represents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the network and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method finds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a model with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the resulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a model with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization with the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion. Specifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS selects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M parameters within 0.3 GPU-days on CIFAR-10, and a top-1 error rate of 23.9% on ImageNet.

Estimating 3D rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures. Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 27th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) 2025</p></details> |

Existing works rely on linear approximations with limited support to customized hardware accelerators. In this work, we propose End-to-end Hardware-aware DNAS (EH-DNAS), a seamless integration of end-to-end hardware benchmarking, and fully automated DNAS to deliver hardware-efficient deep neural networks on various platforms, including Edge GPUs, Edge TPUs, Mobile CPUs, and customized accelerators. Given a desired hardware platform, we propose to learn a differentiable model predicting the end-to-end hardware performance of neural network architectures for DNAS. We also introduce E2E-Perf, an end-to-end hardware benchmarking tool for customized accelerators. Experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that EH-DNAS improves the hardware performance by an average of $1.4\times$ on customized accelerators and $1.6\times$ on existing hardware processors while maintaining the classification accuracy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RhoDARTS: Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search with Density Matrix Simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03697v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Automatic Design of CNNs via Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06993v2)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown good performance in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification due to the automation of feature engineering. Excellent hand-crafted architectures of CNNs incorporated the wisdom of human experts, which is an important reason for CNN's success. However, the design of the architectures is a difficult problem, which needs a lot of professional knowledge as well as computational resources. Moreover, the architecture designed by hand might be suboptimal, because it is only one of thousands of unobserved but objective existed paths. Considering that the success of deep learning is largely due to its automation of the feature engineering process, how to design automatic architecture searching methods to replace the hand-crafted ones is an interesting topic. In this paper, we explore the application of neural architecture search (NAS) in PolSAR area for the first time. Different from the utilization of existing NAS methods, we propose a differentiable architecture search (DAS) method which is customized for PolSAR classification. The proposed DAS is equipped with a PolSAR tailored search space and an improved one-shot search strategy. By DAS, the weights parameters and architecture parameters (corresponds to the hyperparameters but not the topologies) can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent method during the training. The optimized architecture parameters should be transformed into corresponding CNN architecture and re-train to achieve high-precision PolSAR classification. In addition, complex-valued DAS is developed to take into account the characteristics of PolSAR images so as to further improve the performance. Experiments on three PolSAR benchmark datasets show that the CNNs obtained by searching have better classification performance than the hand-crafted ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Robust Differentiable Architecture Search under Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12197v1)** | 2021-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is the game changer in designing robust neural architectures. Architectures designed by NAS outperform or compete with the best manual network designs in terms of accuracy, size, memory footprint and FLOPs. That said, previous studies focus on developing NAS algorithms for clean high quality data, a restrictive and somewhat unrealistic assumption. In this paper, focusing on the differentiable NAS algorithms, we show that vanilla NAS algorithms suffer from a performance loss if class labels are noisy. To combat this issue, we make use of the principle of information bottleneck as a regularizer. This leads us to develop a noise injecting operation that is included during the learning process, preventing the network from learning from noisy samples. Our empirical evaluations show that the noise injecting operation does not degrade the performance of the NAS algorithm if the data is indeed clean. In contrast, if the data is noisy, the architecture learned by our algorithm comfortably outperforms algorithms specifically equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to learn in the presence of label noise. In contrast to many algorithms designed to work in the presence of noisy labels, prior knowledge about the properties of the noise and its characteristics are not required for our algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022</p></details> |
| **[Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for Extremely Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03939v2)** | 2022-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) tasks have achieved significant performance with deep neural networks. However, the large number of parameters in CNN-based met-hods for SISR tasks require heavy computations. Although several efficient SISR models have been recently proposed, most are handcrafted and thus lack flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach on both the cell-level and network-level to search for lightweight SISR models. Specifically, the cell-level search space is designed based on an information distillation mechanism, focusing on the combinations of lightweight operations and aiming to build a more lightweight and accurate SR structure. The network-level search space is designed to consider the feature connections among the cells and aims to find which information flow benefits the cell most to boost the performance. Unlike the existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) based NAS methods for SISR tasks, our search pipeline is fully differentiable, and the lightweight SISR models can be efficiently searched on both the cell-level and network-level jointly on a single GPU. Experiments show that our methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and model complexity with merely 68G Multi-Adds for $\times 2$ and 18G Multi-Adds for $\times 4$ SR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

However, DNAS based methods suffer from memory usage explosion when the search space expands, which may prevent them from running successfully on even advanced GPU platforms. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) based methods, while being memory efficient, are extremely time-consuming. Combining the advantages of both types of methods, this paper presents RADARS, a scalable RL-aided DNAS framework that can explore large search spaces in a fast and memory-efficient manner. RADARS iteratively applies RL to prune undesired architecture candidates and identifies a promising subspace to carry out DNAS. Experiments using a workstation with 12 GB GPU memory show that on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, RADARS can achieve up to 3.41% higher accuracy with 2.5X search time reduction compared with a state-of-the-art RL-based method, while the two DNAS baselines cannot complete due to excessive memory usage or search time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first DNAS framework that can handle large search spaces with bounded memory usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[$α$ DARTS Once More: Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search by Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10105v1)** | 2022-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $α$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

Due to this, previous neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too expensive for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. FBNets, a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. FBNet-B achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than MobileNetV2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's search cost is 420x smaller than MnasNet's, at only 216 GPU-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2. The smallest FBNet achieves 50.2% accuracy and 2.9 ms latency (345 frames per second) on a Samsung S8. Over a Samsung-optimized FBNet, the iPhone-X-optimized model achieves a 1.4x speedup on an iPhone X.</p></details> |  |

However, developing such architectures remains a challenging and resourceintensive process full of trial-and-error iterations. All in all, the relation between the network topology and its ability to model the data remains poorly understood. We propose to encode neural networks with a differentiable variant of Cartesian Genetic Programming (dCGPANN) and present a memetic algorithm for architecture design: local searches with gradient descent learn the network parameters while evolutionary operators act on the dCGPANN genes shaping the network architecture towards faster learning. Studying a particular instance of such a learning scheme, we are able to improve the starting feed forward topology by learning how to rewire and prune links, adapt activation functions and introduce skip connections for chosen regression tasks. The evolved network architectures require less space for network parameters and reach, given the same amount of time, a significantly lower error on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>a sho...</summary><p>a short version of this was accepted as poster paper at GECCO 2019</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge with differentiable quantum architecture search (DiffQAS), enabling trainable circuit parameters and structure weights using gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we enhance training efficiency through asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) methods facilitating parallel training. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed DiffQAS-QRL approach achieves performance comparable to manually-crafted circuit architectures across considered environments, showcasing stability across diverse scenarios.

Yet, researchers are beginning to accumulate increasing amounts of data without having the temporal or monetary resources to integrate these data into scientific theories. We seek to overcome these limitations by incorporating existing machine learning techniques into an open-source pipeline for the automated construction of quantitative models. This pipeline leverages the use of neural architecture search to automate the discovery of interpretable model architectures, and automatic differentiation to automate the fitting of model parameters to data. We evaluate the utility of these methods based on their ability to recover quantitative models of human information processing from synthetic data. We find that these methods are capable of recovering basic quantitative motifs from models of psychophysics, learning and decision making. We also highlight weaknesses of this framework and discuss future directions for their mitigation.</p></details> |  |

However, the huge parameter size makes them difficult to be deployed in real-time applications that require quick inference with limited resources. Existing methods compress BERT into small models while such compression is task-independent, i.e., the same compressed BERT for all different downstream tasks. Motivated by the necessity and benefits of task-oriented BERT compression, we propose a novel compression method, AdaBERT, that leverages differentiable Neural Architecture Search to automatically compress BERT into task-adaptive small models for specific tasks. We incorporate a task-oriented knowledge distillation loss to provide search hints and an efficiency-aware loss as search constraints, which enables a good trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness for task-adaptive BERT compression. We evaluate AdaBERT on several NLP tasks, and the results demonstrate that those task-adaptive compressed models are 12.7x to 29.3x faster than BERT in inference time and 11.5x to 17.0x smaller in terms of parameter size, while comparable performance is maintained.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2020</p></details> |

To maximize model expressive ability, a default choice is to apply a larger and deeper network architecture, which, however, often brings high network latency when generating online recommendations. Naturally, we argue that compressing the heavy recommendation models into middle- or light- weight neural networks is of great importance for practical production systems. To realize such a goal, we propose AdaRec, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework which compresses knowledge of a teacher model into a student model adaptively according to its recommendation scene by using differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we introduce a target-oriented distillation loss to guide the structure search process for finding the student network architecture, and a cost-sensitive loss as constraints for model size, which achieves a superior trade-off between recommendation effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to realize many-to-many layer mapping during knowledge distillation, which enables each intermediate student layer to learn from other intermediate teacher layers adaptively. Extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive or better accuracy with notable inference speedup comparing to strong counterparts, while discovering diverse neural architectures for sequential recommender models under different recommendation scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, these algorithms require a variety of design parameters in the form of user configuration or hard-coded decisions which limit the variety of networks that can be discovered. This means that NAS algorithms do not eliminate model design tuning, they instead merely shift the burden of where that tuning needs to be applied. In this paper, we present SpiderNet, a hybrid differentiable-evolutionary and hardware-aware algorithm that rapidly and efficiently produces state-of-the-art networks. More importantly, SpiderNet is a proof-of-concept of a minimally-configured NAS algorithm; the majority of design choices seen in other algorithms are incorporated into SpiderNet's dynamically-evolving search space, minimizing the number of user choices to just two: reduction cell count and initial channel count. SpiderNet produces models highly-competitive with the state-of-the-art, and outperforms random search in accuracy, runtime, memory size, and parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR-NAS 2022</p></details> |

However, existing methods rely heavily on a black-box controller to search architectures, which suffers from the serious problem of lacking interpretability. In this paper, we propose disentangled neural architecture search (DNAS) which disentangles the hidden representation of the controller into semantically meaningful concepts, making the neural architecture search process interpretable. Based on systematical study, we discover the correlation between network architecture and its performance, and propose a dense-sampling strategy to conduct a targeted search in promising regions that may generate well-performing architectures. We show that: 1) DNAS successfully disentangles the architecture representations, including operation selection, skip connections, and number of layers. 2) Benefiting from interpretability, DNAS can find excellent architectures under different FLOPS restrictions flexibly. 3) Dense-sampling leads to neural architecture search with higher efficiency and better performance. On the NASBench-101 dataset, DNAS achieves state-of-the-art performance of 94.21% using less than 1/13 computational cost of baseline methods. On ImageNet dataset, DNAS discovers the competitive architectures that achieves 22.7% test error. our method provides a new perspective of understanding neural architecture search.</p></details> |  |

We propose a method that aggregates two main results of the previous state-of-the-art in neural architecture search. These are, appealing to the strong sampling efficiency of a search scheme based on sequential model-based optimization (SMBO), and increasing training efficiency by sharing weights among sampled architectures. Sequential search has previously demonstrated its capabilities to find state-of-the-art neural architectures for image classification. However, its computational cost remains high, even unreachable under modest computational settings. Affording SMBO with weight-sharing alleviates this problem. On the other hand, progressive search with SMBO is inherently greedy, as it leverages a learned surrogate function to predict the validation error of neural architectures. This prediction is directly used to rank the sampled neural architectures. We propose to attenuate the greediness of the original SMBO method by relaxing the role of the surrogate function so it predicts architecture sampling probability instead. We demonstrate with experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset that our method, denominated Efficient progressive neural architecture search (EPNAS), leads to increased search efficiency, while retaining competitiveness of found architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the BMVA (BMVC 2018)</p></details> |

Despite its success, it is computationally costly and does not provide an insight on how to design a desirable architecture. Here we propose a new way of searching neural network where we search neural architecture by rewiring the corresponding graph and predict the architecture performance by graph properties. Because we do not perform machine learning over the entire graph space and use predicted architecture performance to search architecture, the searching process is remarkably efficient. We find graph based search can give a reasonably good prediction of desirable architecture. In addition, we find graph properties that are effective to predict architecture performance. Our work proposes a new way of searching neural architecture and provides insights on neural architecture design.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[ReNAS:Relativistic Evaluation of Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01523v7)** | 2021-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective and efficient architecture performance evaluation scheme is essential for the success of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To save computational cost, most of existing NAS algorithms often train and evaluate intermediate neural architectures on a small proxy dataset with limited training epochs. But it is difficult to expect an accurate performance estimation of an architecture in such a coarse evaluation way. This paper advocates a new neural architecture evaluation scheme, which aims to determine which architecture would perform better instead of accurately predict the absolute architecture performance. Therefore, we propose a \textbf{relativistic} architecture performance predictor in NAS (ReNAS). We encode neural architectures into feature tensors, and further refining the representations with the predictor. The proposed relativistic performance predictor can be deployed in discrete searching methods to search for the desired architectures without additional evaluation. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-101 dataset suggests that, sampling 424 ($0.1\%$ of the entire search space) neural architectures and their corresponding validation performance is already enough for learning an accurate architecture performance predictor. The accuracies of our searched neural architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets are higher than that of the state-of-the-art methods and show the priority of the proposed method.</p></details> | CVPR 2021, Oral |

In this paper, we ask the question: can we find high-quality neural architectures using only images, but no human-annotated labels? To answer this question, we first define a new setup called Unsupervised Neural Architecture Search (UnNAS). We then conduct two sets of experiments. In sample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse architectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and find that the architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly correlated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS algorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the architectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts searched with labels. Together, these results reveal the potentially surprising finding that labels are not necessary, and the image statistics alone may be sufficient to identify good neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ECCV 2020 as spotlight.

| **[Federated Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06352v5)** | 2022-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However, training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS.</p></details> |  |

To optimize the proposed sparse supernet, we exploit a hierarchical accelerated proximal gradient algorithm within a bi-level optimization framework.

| **[Contrastive Neural Architecture Search with Neural Architecture Comparators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05471v2)** | 2021-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key steps in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is to estimate the performance of candidate architectures. Existing methods either directly use the validation performance or learn a predictor to estimate the performance. However, these methods can be either computationally expensive or very inaccurate, which may severely affect the search efficiency and performance. Moreover, as it is very difficult to annotate architectures with accurate performance on specific tasks, learning a promising performance predictor is often non-trivial due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we argue that it may not be necessary to estimate the absolute performance for NAS. On the contrary, we may need only to understand whether an architecture is better than a baseline one. However, how to exploit this comparison information as the reward and how to well use the limited labeled data remains two great challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Neural Architecture Search (CTNAS) method which performs architecture search by taking the comparison results between architectures as the reward. Specifically, we design and learn a Neural Architecture Comparator (NAC) to compute the probability of candidate architectures being better than a baseline one. Moreover, we present a baseline updating scheme to improve the baseline iteratively in a curriculum learning manner. More critically, we theoretically show that learning NAC is equivalent to optimizing the ranking over architectures. Extensive experiments in three search spaces demonstrate the superiority of our CTNAS over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by CVPR 2021.

| **[Graph HyperNetworks for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05749v3)** | 2020-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) automatically finds the best task-specific neural network topology, outperforming many manual architecture designs. However, it can be prohibitively expensive as the search requires training thousands of different networks, while each can last for hours. In this work, we propose the Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) to amortize the search cost: given an architecture, it directly generates the weights by running inference on a graph neural network. GHNs model the topology of an architecture and therefore can predict network performance more accurately than regular hypernetworks and premature early stopping. To perform NAS, we randomly sample architectures and use the validation accuracy of networks with GHN generated weights as the surrogate search signal. GHNs are fast -- they can search nearly 10 times faster than other random search methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. GHNs can be further extended to the anytime prediction setting, where they have found networks with better speed-accuracy tradeoff than the state-of-the-art manual designs.</p></details> | ICLR 2019 |

To cope with this problem, we propose an Architecture-Driven Weight Prediction (ADWP) approach for neural architecture search (NAS). In our approach, we first design an architecture-intensive search space and then train a HyperNetwork by inputting stochastic encoding architecture parameters. In the trained HyperNetwork, weights of convolution kernels can be well predicted for neural architectures in the search space. Consequently, the target architectures can be evaluated efficiently without any finetuning, thus enabling us to search fortheoptimalarchitectureinthespaceofgeneralnetworks (macro-search). Through real experiments, we evaluate the performance of the models discovered by the proposed AD-WPNAS and results show that one search procedure can be completed in 4.0 GPU hours on CIFAR-10. Moreover, the discovered model obtains a test error of 2.41% with only 1.52M parameters which is superior to the best existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sub-Architecture Ensemble Pruning in Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00370v2)** | 2022-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is gaining more and more attention in recent years due to its flexibility and remarkable capability to reduce the burden of neural network design. To achieve better performance, however, the searching process usually costs massive computations that might not be affordable for researchers and practitioners. While recent attempts have employed ensemble learning methods to mitigate the enormous computational cost, however, they neglect a key property of ensemble methods, namely diversity, which leads to collecting more similar sub-architectures with potential redundancy in the final design. To tackle this problem, we propose a pruning method for NAS ensembles called "Sub-Architecture Ensemble Pruning in Neural Architecture Search (SAEP)." It targets to leverage diversity and to achieve sub-ensemble architectures at a smaller size with comparable performance to ensemble architectures that are not pruned. Three possible solutions are proposed to decide which sub-architectures to prune during the searching process. Experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed method by largely reducing the number of sub-architectures without degrading the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS.

Recent techniques in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have proven to be competitive or better than traditional handcrafted design, although they require domain knowledge and have generally used limited search spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for neural architecture search, utilizing a dictionary of models of base tasks and the similarity between the target task and the atoms of the dictionary; hence, generating an adaptive search space based on the base models of the dictionary. By introducing a gradient-based search algorithm, we can evaluate and discover the best architecture in the search space without fully training the networks. The experimental results show the efficacy of our proposed task-aware approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we present an approach called Conceptual Expansion Neural Architecture Search (CENAS) that combines a sample-efficient, computational creativity-inspired transfer learning approach with neural architecture search. This approach finds models faster than naive architecture search via transferring existing weights to approximate the parameters of the new model. It outperforms standard transfer learning by allowing for the addition of features instead of only modifying existing features.

| **[Probabilistic Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05116v1)** | 2019-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In neural architecture search (NAS), the space of neural network architectures is automatically explored to maximize predictive accuracy for a given task. Despite the success of recent approaches, most existing methods cannot be directly applied to large scale problems because of their prohibitive computational complexity or high memory usage. In this work, we propose a Probabilistic approach to neural ARchitecture SEarCh (PARSEC) that drastically reduces memory requirements while maintaining state-of-the-art computational complexity, making it possible to directly search over more complex architectures and larger datasets. Our approach only requires as much memory as is needed to train a single architecture from our search space. This is due to a memory-efficient sampling procedure wherein we learn a probability distribution over high-performing neural network architectures. Importantly, this framework enables us to transfer the distribution of architectures learnt on smaller problems to larger ones, further reducing the computational cost. We showcase the advantages of our approach in applications to CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where our approach outperforms methods with double its computational cost and matches the performance of methods with costs that are three orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binarized Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10862v2)** | 2020-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) can have a significant impact in computer vision by automatically designing optimal neural network architectures for various tasks. A variant, binarized neural architecture search (BNAS), with a search space of binarized convolutions, can produce extremely compressed models. Unfortunately, this area remains largely unexplored. BNAS is more challenging than NAS due to the learning inefficiency caused by optimization requirements and the huge architecture space. To address these issues, we introduce channel sampling and operation space reduction into a differentiable NAS to significantly reduce the cost of searching. This is accomplished through a performance-based strategy used to abandon less potential operations. Two optimization methods for binarized neural networks are used to validate the effectiveness of our BNAS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BNAS achieves a performance comparable to NAS on both CIFAR and ImageNet databases. An accuracy of $96.53\%$ vs. $97.22\%$ is achieved on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but with a significantly compressed model, and a $40\%$ faster search than the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have small search space, which is easier to optimize but has a limited upper bound of the optimal solution. Extra human design is needed for those methods to propose a more suitable space with respect to the specific task and algorithm capacity. To further enhance the degree of automation for neural architecture search, we present a Neural Search-space Evolution (NSE) scheme that iteratively amplifies the results from the previous effort by maintaining an optimized search space subset. This design minimizes the necessity of a well-designed search space. We further extend the flexibility of obtainable architectures by introducing a learnable multi-branch setting. By employing the proposed method, a consistent performance gain is achieved during a progressive search over upcoming search spaces. We achieve 77.3% top-1 retrain accuracy on ImageNet with 333M FLOPs, which yielded a state-of-the-art performance among previous auto-generated architectures that do not involve knowledge distillation or weight pruning. When the latency constraint is adopted, our result also performs better than the previous best-performing mobile models with a 77.9% Top-1 retrain accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2021 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2021)</p></details> |

Recent neural architecture search (NAS) approaches rely on validation loss or accuracy to find the superior network for the target data.

We demonstrate that the flatness of the loss surface can be a promising proxy for predicting the generalization capability of neural network architectures. We evaluate our proposed method on various search spaces, showing similar or even better performance compared to the state-of-the-art NAS methods. Notably, the resultant architecture found by flatness measure generalizes robustly to various shifts in data distribution (e.g. ImageNet-V2,-A,-O), as well as various tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

However, NAS-generated models tends to suffer greater vulnerability to various malicious attacks. Lots of robust NAS methods leverage adversarial training to enhance the robustness of NAS-generated models, however, they neglected the nature accuracy of NAS-generated models. In our paper, we propose a novel NAS method, Robust Neural Architecture Search (RNAS). To design a regularization term to balance accuracy and robustness, RNAS generates architectures with both high accuracy and good robustness. To reduce search cost, we further propose to use noise examples instead adversarial examples as input to search architectures. Extensive experiments show that RNAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both image classification and adversarial attacks, which illustrates the proposed RNAS achieves a good tradeoff between robustness and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Despite the widespread use, architecture representations learned in NAS are still poorly understood. We observe that the structural properties of neural architectures are hard to preserve in the latent space if architecture representation learning and search are coupled, resulting in less effective search performance. In this work, we find empirically that pre-training architecture representations using only neural architectures without their accuracies as labels considerably improve the downstream architecture search efficiency. To explain these observations, we visualize how unsupervised architecture representation learning better encourages neural architectures with similar connections and operators to cluster together. This helps to map neural architectures with similar performance to the same regions in the latent space and makes the transition of architectures in the latent space relatively smooth, which considerably benefits diverse downstream search strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2020 camera-ready.

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS) against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for child networks.

However, its application is restricted by noncontinuous and high-dimensional search spaces, which result in difficulty in optimization. To resolve these problems, we proposed NAS in embedding space (NASES), which is a novel framework. Unlike other NAS with reinforcement learning approaches that search over a discrete and high-dimensional architecture space, this approach enables reinforcement learning to search in an embedding space by using architecture encoders and decoders. The current experiment demonstrated that the performance of the final architecture network using the NASES procedure is comparable with that of other popular NAS approaches for the image classification task on CIFAR-10. The results of the experiment were efficient and indicated that NASES was highly efficient to discover final architecture only in $<$3.5 GPU hours. The beneficial-performance and effectiveness of NASES was impressive when the architecture-embedding searching and weight initialization were applied.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In this work, NAS is reformulated as an optimization problem on parameters of a joint distribution for the search space in a cell. To leverage the gradient information in generic differentiable loss for architecture search, a novel search gradient is proposed. We prove that this search gradient optimizes the same objective as reinforcement-learning-based NAS, but assigns credits to structural decisions more efficiently. This credit assignment is further augmented with locally decomposable reward to enforce a resource-efficient constraint. In experiments on CIFAR-10, SNAS takes less epochs to find a cell architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy than non-differentiable evolution-based and reinforcement-learning-based NAS, which is also transferable to ImageNet. It is also shown that child networks of SNAS can maintain the validation accuracy in searching, with which attention-based NAS requires parameter retraining to compete, exhibiting potentials to stride towards efficient NAS on big datasets.

In this paper, we propose to evaluate the NAS search phase. To this end, we compare the quality of the solutions obtained by NAS search policies with that of random architecture selection. We find that: (i) On average, the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms perform similarly to the random policy; (ii) the widely-used weight sharing strategy degrades the ranking of the NAS candidates to the point of not reflecting their true performance, thus reducing the effectiveness of the search process.

| **[Efficient Global Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03553v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown promise towards automating neural network design for a given task, but it is computationally demanding due to training costs associated with evaluating a large number of architectures to find the optimal one. To speed up NAS, recent works limit the search to network building blocks (modular search) instead of searching the entire architecture (global search), approximate candidates' performance evaluation in lieu of complete training, and use gradient descent rather than naturally suitable discrete optimization approaches. However, modular search does not determine network's macro architecture i.e. depth and width, demanding manual trial and error post-search, hence lacking automation. In this work, we revisit NAS and design a navigable, yet architecturally diverse, macro-micro search space. In addition, to determine relative rankings of candidates, existing methods employ consistent approximations across entire search spaces, whereas different networks may not be fairly comparable under one training protocol. Hence, we propose an architecture-aware approximation with variable training schemes for different networks. Moreover, we develop an efficient search strategy by disjoining macro-micro network design that yields competitive architectures in terms of both accuracy and size. Our proposed framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on EMNIST and KMNIST, while being highly competitive on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FashionMNIST datasets and being 2-4x faster than the fastest global search methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the transferability of our framework to real-world computer vision problems by discovering competitive architectures for face recognition applications.</p></details> | CAIP2023 |

In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS (GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in their original search space.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 13 Tables</p></details> |

EPNAS is designed to search target networks in parallel, which is more scalable on parallel systems such as GPU/TPU clusters. More importantly, EPNAS can be generalized to architecture search with multiple resource constraints, \eg, model size, compute complexity or intensity, which is crucial for deployment in widespread platforms such as mobile and cloud. We compare EPNAS against other state-of-the-art (SoTA) network architectures (\eg, MobileNetV2~\cite{mobilenetv2}) and efficient NAS algorithms (\eg, ENAS~\cite{pham2018efficient}, and PNAS~\cite{Liu2017b}) on image recognition tasks using CIFAR10 and ImageNet. On both datasets, EPNAS is superior \wrt architecture searching speed and recognition accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05866v2)** | 2019-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have traditionally been explored by human experts in a manual search process that is time-consuming and ineffectively explores the massive space of potential solutions. Neural architecture search (NAS) methods automatically search the space of neural network hyperparameters in order to find optimal task-specific architectures. NAS methods have discovered CNN architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification among other tasks, however the application of NAS to image-to-image regression problems such as image restoration is sparse. This paper proposes a NAS method that performs computationally efficient evolutionary search of a minimally constrained network architecture search space. The performance of architectures discovered by the proposed method is evaluated on a variety of image restoration tasks applied to the ImageNet64x64 dataset, and compared with human-engineered CNN architectures. The best neural architectures discovered using only 2 GPU-hours of evolutionary search exhibit comparable performance to the human-engineered baseline architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IJCNN 2019</p></details> |
| **[Differentially-private Federated Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10559v2)** | 2020-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search, which aims to automatically search for architectures (e.g., convolution, max pooling) of neural networks that maximize validation performance, has achieved remarkable progress recently. In many application scenarios, several parties would like to collaboratively search for a shared neural architecture by leveraging data from all parties. However, due to privacy concerns, no party wants its data to be seen by other parties. To address this problem, we propose federated neural architecture search (FNAS), where different parties collectively search for a differentiable architecture by exchanging gradients of architecture variables without exposing their data to other parties. To further preserve privacy, we study differentially-private FNAS (DP-FNAS), which adds random noise to the gradients of architecture variables. We provide theoretical guarantees of DP-FNAS in achieving differential privacy. Experiments show that DP-FNAS can search highly-performant neural architectures while protecting the privacy of individual parties.

This paper introduces Neuvo Ecological Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a novel method that incorporates these evolutionary parameters directly into the candidate solutions' phenotypes, allowing them to evolve dynamically alongside architecture specifications. Experimental results across four binary classification datasets demonstrate that ENAS not only eliminates manual tuning of evolutionary parameters but also outperforms competitor NAS methodologies in convergence speed (reducing computational time by 18.3%) and accuracy (improving classification performance in 3 out of 4 datasets). By enabling "greedy individuals" to optimize resource allocation based on fitness, ENAS provides an efficient, self-regulating approach to neural architecture search.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

To obtain optimal data-specific GNN architectures, researchers turn to neural architecture search (NAS) methods, which have made impressive progress in discovering effective architectures in convolutional neural networks. Two preliminary works, GraphNAS and Auto-GNN, have made first attempt to apply NAS methods to GNN. Despite the promising results, there are several drawbacks in expressive capability and search efficiency of GraphNAS and Auto-GNN due to the designed search space. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the SNAG framework (Simplified Neural Architecture search for Graph neural networks), consisting of a novel search space and a reinforcement learning based search algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNAG framework compared to human-designed GNNs and NAS methods, including GraphNAS and Auto-GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2020 Workshop: 1st Workshop Combining Symbolic and Subsymbolic Methods and their Applications</p></details> |

Further, we model our new NAS problem with a one-shot training process of a single supernet. Based on the supernet modeling, we exploit a differentiable NAS algorithm on our relaxed continuous search space for SPD neural architecture search. Statistical evaluation of our method on drone, action, and emotion recognition tasks mostly provides better results than the state-of-the-art SPD networks and traditional NAS algorithms. Empirical results show that our algorithm excels in discovering better performing SPD network design and provides models that are more than three times lighter than searched by the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication at IJCAI 2021</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose the Reinforced Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (RE- NAS), which is an evolutionary method with the reinforced mutation for NAS. Our method integrates reinforced mutation into an evolution algorithm for neural architecture exploration, in which a mutation controller is introduced to learn the effects of slight modifications and make mutation actions. The reinforced mutation controller guides the model population to evolve efficiently. Furthermore, as child models can inherit parameters from their parents during evolution, our method requires very limited computational resources. In experiments, we conduct the proposed search method on CIFAR-10 and obtain a powerful network architecture, RENASNet. This architecture achieves a competitive result on CIFAR-10. The explored network architecture is transferable to ImageNet and achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy, i.e., 75.7% top-1 accuracy with 5.36M parameters on mobile ImageNet. We further test its performance on semantic segmentation with DeepLabv3 on the PASCAL VOC. RENASNet outperforms MobileNet-v1, MobileNet-v2 and NASNet. It achieves 75.83% mIOU without being pre-trained on COCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Neural Architecture Search with Performance Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01854v1)** | 2021-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are powerful models that have a remarkable ability to extract patterns that are too complex to be noticed by humans or other machine learning models. Neural networks are the first class of models that can train end-to-end systems with large learning capacities. However, we still have the difficult challenge of designing the neural network, which requires human experience and a long process of trial and error. As a solution, we can use a neural architecture search to find the best network architecture for the task at hand. Existing NAS algorithms generally evaluate the fitness of a new architecture by fully training from scratch, resulting in the prohibitive computational cost, even if operated on high-performance computers. In this paper, an end-to-end offline performance predictor is proposed to accelerate the evaluation of sampled architectures.

The choice of the network architecture has proven to be critical, and many advances in deep learning spring from its immediate improvements. However, deep learning techniques are computationally intensive and their application requires a high level of domain knowledge. Therefore, even partial automation of this process helps to make deep learning more accessible to both researchers and practitioners. With this survey, we provide a formalism which unifies and categorizes the landscape of existing methods along with a detailed analysis that compares and contrasts the different approaches. We achieve this via a comprehensive discussion of the commonly adopted architecture search spaces and architecture optimization algorithms based on principles of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms along with approaches that incorporate surrogate and one-shot models. Additionally, we address the new research directions which include constrained and multi-objective architecture search as well as automated data augmentation, optimizer and activation function search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10355v3)** | 2022-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained huge attention as a potential energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent high-sparsity activation. However, most prior SNN methods use ANN-like architectures (e.g., VGG-Net or ResNet), which could provide sub-optimal performance for temporal sequence processing of binary information in SNNs. To address this, in this paper, we introduce a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach for finding better SNN architectures. Inspired by recent NAS approaches that find the optimal architecture from activation patterns at initialization, we select the architecture that can represent diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples without training. Moreover, to further leverage the temporal information among the spikes, we search for feed forward connections as well as backward connections (i.e., temporal feedback connections) between layers. Interestingly, SNASNet found by our search algorithm achieves higher performance with backward connections, demonstrating the importance of designing SNN architecture for suitably using temporal information. We conduct extensive experiments on three image recognition benchmarks where we show that SNASNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower timesteps (5 timesteps).

| **[BANANAS: Bayesian Optimization with Neural Architectures for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11858v3)** | 2022-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past half-decade, many methods have been considered for neural architecture search (NAS). Bayesian optimization (BO), which has long had success in hyperparameter optimization, has recently emerged as a very promising strategy for NAS when it is coupled with a neural predictor. Recent work has proposed different instantiations of this framework, for example, using Bayesian neural networks or graph convolutional networks as the predictive model within BO. However, the analyses in these papers often focus on the full-fledged NAS algorithm, so it is difficult to tell which individual components of the framework lead to the best performance. In this work, we give a thorough analysis of the "BO + neural predictor" framework by identifying five main components: the architecture encoding, neural predictor, uncertainty calibration method, acquisition function, and acquisition optimization strategy. We test several different methods for each component and also develop a novel path-based encoding scheme for neural architectures, which we show theoretically and empirically scales better than other encodings. Using all of our analyses, we develop a final algorithm called BANANAS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAS search spaces. We adhere to the NAS research checklist (Lindauer and Hutter 2019) to facilitate best practices, and our code is available at https://github.com/naszilla/naszilla.</p></details> |  |

Using the task of keyword spotting in audio on edge computing devices, we demonstrate that our approach results in neural architecture that is not only highly accurate, but also efficiently mapped to the computing platform which will perform the inference. Using our modified neural architecture search, we demonstrate $0.88\%$ increase in TOP-1 accuracy with $1.85\times$ reduction in latency for keyword spotting in audio on an embedded SoC, and $1.59\times$ on a high-end GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2019 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation</p></details> |

Performance predictors have seen widespread use in low-cost NAS and achieve high ranking correlations between predicted and ground truth performance in several NAS benchmarks. However, existing predictors are often designed based on network encodings specific to a predefined search space and are therefore not generalizable to other search spaces or new architecture families. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose neural predictor for NAS that can transfer across search spaces, by representing any given candidate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Computation Graph (CG) that consists of primitive operators. We further combine our CG network representation with Contrastive Learning (CL) and propose a graph representation learning procedure that leverages the structural information of unlabeled architectures from multiple families to train CG embeddings for our performance predictor. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-101, 201 and 301 demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme as we achieve strong positive Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) on every search space, outperforming several Zero-Cost Proxies, including Synflow and Jacov, which are also generalizable predictors across search spaces. Moreover, when using our proposed general-purpose predictor in an evolutionary neural architecture search algorithm, we can find high-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and find a MobileNetV3 architecture that attains 79.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SDM2023; version includes supplementary material; 12 Pages, 3 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, the success of NAS depends on the definition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static sequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each possible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more expressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each decision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model iterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in simulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and branching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auto-GNN: Neural Architecture Search of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03184v2)** | 2019-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to operate on the graph-structured data. Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and tremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN architecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is significantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as aggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning tasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot be directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN is different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation learning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight architecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional search methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing might become unstable in GNN. To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN) framework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined search space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily validate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing strategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a carefully-designed homogeneity definition. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GNN architecture identified by AGNN achieves the best performance, comparing with existing handcrafted models and tradistional search methods.</p></details> |  |

Still, they are prone to adversarial attacks, which are massive threats to applying GNNs to risk-sensitive domains. Existing defensive methods neither guarantee performance facing new data/tasks or adversarial attacks nor provide insights to understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has the potential to solve this problem by automating GNN architecture designs. Nevertheless, current graph NAS approaches lack robust design and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Robust Neural Architecture search framework for GNNs (G-RNA). Specifically, we design a robust search space for the message-passing mechanism by adding graph structure mask operations into the search space, which comprises various defensive operation candidates and allows us to search for defensive GNNs. Furthermore, we define a robustness metric to guide the search procedure, which helps to filter robust architectures. In this way, G-RNA helps understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective and effectively searches for optimal adversarial robust GNNs. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that G-RNA significantly outperforms manually designed robust GNNs and vanilla graph NAS baselines by 12.1% to 23.4% under adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at CVPR 2023</p></details> |

Hence, a method and a tool support is needed to assist users of neural architectures, leading to an eagerness in the field of Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML). When it comes to Deep Learning, an important part of AutoML is the Neural Architecture Search (NAS).

However, traditional NAS algorithms are slow and require immense amounts of computing power. Recent research has investigated training-free NAS metrics for image classification architectures, drastically speeding up search algorithms. In this paper, we investigate training-free NAS metrics for recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT-based transformer architectures, targeted towards language modeling tasks. First, we develop a new training-free metric, named hidden covariance, that predicts the trained performance of an RNN architecture and significantly outperforms existing training-free metrics. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the hidden covariance metric on the NAS-Bench-NLP benchmark. Second, we find that the current search space paradigm for transformer architectures is not optimized for training-free neural architecture search. Instead, a simple qualitative analysis can effectively shrink the search space to the best performing architectures. This conclusion is based on our investigation of existing training-free metrics and new metrics developed from recent transformer pruning literature, evaluated on our own benchmark of trained BERT architectures. Ultimately, our analysis shows that the architecture search space and the training-free metric must be developed together in order to achieve effective results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/aaronserianni/training-free-nas</p></details> |

Current NAS methods are far from ab initio and automatic, as they use manual backbone architectures or micro building blocks (cells), which have had minor breakthroughs in performance compared to random baselines. They also involve a significant manual expert effort in various components of the NAS pipeline. This raises a natural question - Are the current NAS methods still heavily dependent on manual effort in the search space design and wiring like it was done when building models before the advent of NAS? In this paper, instead of merely chasing slight improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, we revisit the fundamental approach to NAS and propose a novel approach called ReNAS that can search for the complete neural network without much human effort and is a step closer towards AutoML-nirvana. Our method starts from a complete graph mapped to a neural network and searches for the connections and operations by balancing the exploration and exploitation of the search space. The results are on-par with the SOTA performance with methods that leverage handcrafted blocks. We believe that this approach may lead to newer NAS strategies for a variety of network types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a self-supervised neural architecture search (SSNAS) that allows finding novel network models without the need for labeled data. We show that such a search leads to comparable results to supervised training with a "fully labeled" NAS and that it can improve the performance of self-supervised learning. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach when the number of labels in the search is relatively small.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploiting Operation Importance for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10511v1)** | 2019-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, differentiable neural architecture search methods significantly reduce the search cost by constructing a super network and relax the architecture representation by assigning architecture weights to the candidate operations. All the existing methods determine the importance of each operation directly by architecture weights. However, architecture weights cannot accurately reflect the importance of each operation; that is, the operation with the highest weight might not related to the best performance. To alleviate this deficiency, we propose a simple yet effective solution to neural architecture search, termed as exploiting operation importance for effective neural architecture search (EoiNAS), in which a new indicator is proposed to fully exploit the operation importance and guide the model search. Based on this new indicator, we propose a gradual operation pruning strategy to further improve the search efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.50\% on CIFAR-10, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. When transferred to ImageNet, it achieves the top-1 error of 25.6\%, comparable to the state-of-the-art performance under the mobile setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search using Progressive Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01559v1)** | 2022-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vanilla neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms (EA) involves evaluating each architecture by training it from scratch, which is extremely time-consuming. This can be reduced by using a supernet to estimate the fitness of every architecture in the search space due to its weight sharing nature. However, the estimated fitness is very noisy due to the co-adaptation of the operations in the supernet. In this work, we propose a method called pEvoNAS wherein the whole neural architecture search space is progressively reduced to smaller search space regions with good architectures. This is achieved by using a trained supernet for architecture evaluation during the architecture search using genetic algorithm to find search space regions with good architectures. Upon reaching the final reduced search space, the supernet is then used to search for the best architecture in that search space using evolution. The search is also enhanced by using weight inheritance wherein the supernet for the smaller search space inherits its weights from previous trained supernet for the bigger search space. Exerimentally, pEvoNAS gives better results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 while using significantly less computational resources as compared to previous EA-based methods.

In this paper, we propose a parallel graph architecture search (GraphPAS) framework for graph neural networks. In GraphPAS, we explore the search space in parallel by designing a sharing-based evolution learning, which can improve the search efficiency without losing the accuracy. Additionally, architecture information entropy is adopted dynamically for mutation selection probability, which can reduce space exploration.

To advance the architecture search, we present a graph diffusion-based NAS approach that uses discrete conditional graph diffusion processes to generate high-performing neural network architectures. We then propose a multi-conditioned classifier-free guidance approach applied to graph diffusion networks to jointly impose constraints such as high accuracy and low hardware latency. Unlike the related work, our method is completely differentiable and requires only a single model training. In our evaluations, we show promising results on six standard benchmarks, yielding novel and unique architectures at a fast speed, i.e. less than 0.2 seconds per architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalisability and efficiency of our method through experiments on ImageNet dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

NAS adopts a search strategy to explore the predefined search space to find outstanding performance architecture with the minimum searching costs. Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms are two commonly used search strategies, but they suffer from computationally expensive, challenge to implement or inefficient exploration ability. In this paper, we propose a neural predictor guided evolutionary algorithm to enhance the exploration ability of EA for NAS (NPENAS) and design two kinds of neural predictors. The first predictor is defined from Bayesian optimization and we propose a graph-based uncertainty estimation network as a surrogate model that is easy to implement and computationally efficient. The second predictor is a graph-based neural network that directly outputs the performance prediction of the input neural architecture. The NPENAS using the two neural predictors are denoted as NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP respectively. In addition, we introduce a new random architecture sampling method to overcome the drawbacks of the existing sampling method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of NPENAS. Quantitative results on three NAS search spaces indicate that both NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP outperform most existing NAS algorithms, with NPENAS-BO achieving state-of-the-art performance on NASBench-201 and NPENAS-NP on NASBench-101 and DARTS, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, it is often the case a well-trained ML model does not fit to the constraint of deploying edge platforms, causing a long iteration of model reduction and retraining process. Moreover, a ML model optimized for platform-A often may not be suitable when we deploy it on another platform-B, causing another iteration of model retraining. We propose a conditional neural architecture search method using GAN, which produces feasible ML models for different platforms. We present a new workflow to generate constraint-optimized DNN models. This is the first work of bringing in condition and adversarial technique into Neural Architecture Search domain. We verify the method with regression problems and classification on CIFAR-10. The proposed workflow can successfully generate resource-optimized MLP or CNN-based networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Effective, Efficient and Robust Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09820v1)** | 2020-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in adversarial attacks show the vulnerability of deep neural networks searched by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Although NAS methods can find network architectures with the state-of-the-art performance, the adversarial robustness and resource constraint are often ignored in NAS. To solve this problem, we propose an Effective, Efficient, and Robust Neural Architecture Search (E2RNAS) method to search a neural network architecture by taking the performance, robustness, and resource constraint into consideration. The objective function of the proposed E2RNAS method is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem with the upper-level problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is different from existing NAS methods. To solve the proposed objective function, we integrate the multiple-gradient descent algorithm, a widely studied gradient-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, with the bi-level optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed E2RNAS method can find adversarially robust architectures with optimized model size and comparable classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Neural Architecture Search and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09426v1)** | 2018-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing neural architectures is a fundamental step in deep learning applications. As a partner technique, model compression on neural networks has been widely investigated to gear the needs that the deep learning algorithms could be run with the limited computation resources on mobile devices. Currently, both the tasks of architecture design and model compression require expertise tricks and tedious trials. In this paper, we integrate these two tasks into one unified framework, which enables the joint architecture search with quantization (compression) policies for neural networks. This method is named JASQ. Here our goal is to automatically find a compact neural network model with high performance that is suitable for mobile devices. Technically, a multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm is introduced to search the models under the balance between model size and performance accuracy. In experiments, we find that our approach outperforms the methods that search only for architectures or only for quantization policies. 1) Specifically, given existing networks, our approach can provide them with learning-based quantization policies, and outperforms their 2 bits, 4 bits, 8 bits, and 16 bits counterparts. It can yield higher accuracies than the float models, for example, over 1.02% higher accuracy on MobileNet-v1. 2) What is more, under the balance between model size and performance accuracy, two models are obtained with joint search of architectures and quantization policies: a high-accuracy model and a small model, JASQNet and JASQNet-Small that achieves 2.97% error rate with 0.9 MB on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers study neural architecture search (NAS) to reduce the dependence of human expertise and explore better GNN architectures, but they over-emphasize entity features and ignore latent relation information concealed in the edges. To solve this problem, we incorporate edge features into graph search space and propose Edge-featured Graph Neural Architecture Search to find the optimal GNN architecture. Specifically, we design rich entity and edge updating operations to learn high-order representations, which convey more generic message passing mechanisms. Moreover, the architecture topology in our search space allows to explore complex feature dependence of both entities and edges, which can be efficiently optimized by differentiable search strategy. Experiments at three graph tasks on six datasets show EGNAS can search better GNNs with higher performance than current state-of-the-art human-designed and searched-based GNNs.</p></details> |  |

We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AutoML 25, Project page at: https://shiwenqin.github.io/TransferrableSurrogate/</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Neural Architecture Search Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00438v2)** | 2019-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic methods for generating state-of-the-art neural network architectures without human experts have generated significant attention recently. This is because of the potential to remove human experts from the design loop which can reduce costs and decrease time to model deployment. Neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have improved significantly in their computational efficiency since the original NAS was proposed. This reduction in computation is enabled via weight sharing such as in Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). However, recently a body of work confirms our discovery that ENAS does not do significantly better than random search with weight sharing, contradicting the initial claims of the authors. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by investigating the interpretability of the ENAS controller's hidden state. We find models sampled from identical controller hidden states have no correlation with various graph similarity metrics, so no notion of structural similarity is learned. This failure mode implies the RNN controller does not condition on past architecture choices. Lastly, we propose a solution to this failure mode by forcing the controller's hidden state to encode pasts decisions by training it with a memory buffer of previously sampled architectures. Doing this improves hidden state interpretability by increasing the correlation between controller hidden states and graph similarity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generic Neural Architecture Search via Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01899v2)** | 2021-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to and evaluated by the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However, extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on different downstream tasks. In this paper, we attempt to answer two fundamental questions related to NAS. (1) Is it necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and search for good neural architectures? (2) Can we perform NAS effectively and efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream tasks? To answer these questions, we propose a novel and generic NAS framework, termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but instead adopts regression on a set of manually designed synthetic signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of training samples. Extensive experiments across 13 CNN search spaces and one NLP space demonstrate the remarkable efficiency of GenNAS using regression, in terms of both evaluating the neural architectures (quantified by the ranking correlation Spearman's rho between the approximated performances and the downstream task performances) and the convergence speed for training (within a few seconds).</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2021, 10 pages + Reference + Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01436v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in finding the best graph neural network architecture on a given graph dataset. However, existing GNAS methods still require intensive human labor and rich domain knowledge when designing the search space and search strategy. To this end, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into GNAS and present a new GNAS model based on LLMs (GNAS-LLM for short). The basic idea of GNAS-LLM is to design a new class of GNAS prompts for LLMs to guide LLMs towards understanding the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running LLMs with the prompts, GNAS-LLM generates more accurate graph neural network architectures with fast convergence. Experimental results show that GNAS-LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods on four benchmark graph datasets, with an average improvement of 0.7% on the validation sets and 0.3% on the test sets. Besides, GNAS-LLM achieves an average improvement of 1.0% on the test sets based on the search space from AutoGEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Compact Architecture Search For Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06466v1)** | 2019-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of compact deep neural networks is a crucial task to enable widespread adoption of deep neural networks in the real-world, particularly for edge and mobile scenarios. Due to the time-consuming and challenging nature of manually designing compact deep neural networks, there has been significant recent research interest into algorithms that automatically search for compact network architectures. A particularly interesting class of compact architecture search algorithms are those that are guided by baseline network architectures. Such algorithms have been shown to be significantly more computationally efficient than unguided methods. In this study, we explore the current state of compact architecture search for deep neural networks through both theoretical and empirical analysis of four different state-of-the-art compact architecture search algorithms: i) group lasso regularization, ii) variational dropout, iii) MorphNet, and iv) Generative Synthesis. We examine these methods in detail based on a number of different factors such as efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. Furthermore, empirical evaluations are conducted to compare the efficacy of these compact architecture search algorithms across three well-known benchmark datasets. While by no means an exhaustive exploration, we hope that this study helps provide insights into the interesting state of this relatively new area of research in terms of diversity and real, tangible gains already achieved in architecture design improvements. Furthermore, the hope is that this study would help in pushing the conversation forward towards a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding where the research community currently stands in the landscape of compact architecture search for deep neural networks, and the practical challenges and considerations in leveraging such approaches for operational usage.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[A Study of the Learning Progress in Neural Architecture Search Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07590v1)** | 2019-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In neural architecture search, the structure of the neural network to best model a given dataset is determined by an automated search process. Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), proposed by Pham et al. (2018), has recently received considerable attention due to its ability to find excellent architectures within a comparably short search time. In this work, which is motivated by the quest to further improve the learning speed of architecture search, we evaluate the learning progress of the controller which generates the architectures in ENAS. We measure the progress by comparing the architectures generated by it at different controller training epochs, where architectures are evaluated after having re-trained them from scratch. As a surprising result, we find that the learning curves are completely flat, i.e., there is no observable progress of the controller in terms of the performance of its generated architectures. This observation is consistent across the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and two different search spaces. We conclude that the high quality of the models generated by ENAS is a result of the search space design rather than the controller training, and our results indicate that one-shot architecture design is an efficient alternative to architecture search by ENAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Neural Architecture Search with Morphism-based Transformable Backbone Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07211v1)** | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims at making the architecture search process more adaptive for one-shot or online training. It is extended from the existing study on differentiable neural architecture search, and we made the backbone architecture transformable rather than fixed during the training process. As is known, differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) requires a pre-defined over-parameterized backbone architecture, while its size is to be determined manually. Also, in DARTS backbone, Hadamard product of two elements is not introduced, which exists in both LSTM and GRU cells for recurrent nets. This study introduces a growing mechanism for differentiable neural architecture search based on network morphism. It enables growing of the cell structures from small size towards large size ones with one-shot training. Two modes can be applied in integrating the growing and original pruning process. We also implement a recently proposed two-input backbone architecture for recurrent neural networks. Initial experimental results indicate that our approach and the two-input backbone structure can be quite effective compared with other baseline architectures including LSTM, in a variety of learning tasks including multi-variate time series forecasting and language modeling. On the other hand, we find that dynamic network transformation is promising in improving the efficiency of differentiable architecture search.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study on Encodings for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04965v2)** | 2022-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has been extensively studied in the past few years. A popular approach is to represent each neural architecture in the search space as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then search over all DAGs by encoding the adjacency matrix and list of operations as a set of hyperparameters. Recent work has demonstrated that even small changes to the way each architecture is encoded can have a significant effect on the performance of NAS algorithms. In this work, we present the first formal study on the effect of architecture encodings for NAS, including a theoretical grounding and an empirical study. First we formally define architecture encodings and give a theoretical characterization on the scalability of the encodings we study Then we identify the main encoding-dependent subroutines which NAS algorithms employ, running experiments to show which encodings work best with each subroutine for many popular algorithms. The experiments act as an ablation study for prior work, disentangling the algorithmic and encoding-based contributions, as well as a guideline for future work. Our results demonstrate that NAS encodings are an important design decision which can have a significant impact on overall performance.

| **[GPT-NAS: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with the Generative Pre-Trained Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05351v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as one of the effective methods to design the optimal neural network architecture automatically. Although neural architectures have achieved human-level performances in several tasks, few of them are obtained from the NAS method. The main reason is the huge search space of neural architectures, making NAS algorithms inefficient. This work presents a novel architecture search algorithm, called GPT-NAS, that optimizes neural architectures by Generative Pre-Trained (GPT) model with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as the search strategy. In GPT-NAS, we assume that a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus could learn the fundamental law of building neural architectures. Therefore, GPT-NAS leverages the GPT model to propose reasonable architecture components given the basic one and then utilizes EAs to search for the optimal solution. Such an approach can largely reduce the search space by introducing prior knowledge in the search process. Extensive experimental results show that our GPT-NAS method significantly outperforms seven manually designed neural architectures and thirteen architectures provided by competing NAS methods. In addition, our experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of finely tuned neural architectures by up to about 12% compared to those without GPT, further demonstrating its effectiveness in searching neural architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Architecture Search for Class-incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06686v1)** | 2019-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In class-incremental learning, a model learns continuously from a sequential data stream in which new classes occur. Existing methods often rely on static architectures that are manually crafted. These methods can be prone to capacity saturation because a neural network's ability to generalize to new concepts is limited by its fixed capacity. To understand how to expand a continual learner, we focus on the neural architecture design problem in the context of class-incremental learning: at each time step, the learner must optimize its performance on all classes observed so far by selecting the most competitive neural architecture. To tackle this problem, we propose Continual Neural Architecture Search (CNAS): an autoML approach that takes advantage of the sequential nature of class-incremental learning to efficiently and adaptively identify strong architectures in a continual learning setting. We employ a task network to perform the classification task and a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller for architecture search. In addition, we apply network transformations to transfer weights from previous learning step and to reduce the size of the architecture search space, thus saving a large amount of computational resources. We evaluate CNAS on the CIFAR-100 dataset under varied incremental learning scenarios with limited computational power (1 GPU). Experimental results demonstrate that CNAS outperforms architectures that are optimized for the entire dataset. In addition, CNAS is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than naively using existing autoML methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 Figures |

In this paper, we focus on the search strategy. We introduce the simple yet powerful evolutionary algorithm of differential evolution to the NAS community. Using the simplest performance evaluation strategy of full evaluations, we comprehensively compare this search strategy to regularized evolution and Bayesian optimization and demonstrate that it yields improved and more robust results for 13 tabular NAS benchmarks based on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-1Shot1, NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-HPO bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical quantum circuit representations for neural architecture search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15073v3)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning with hierarchical quantum circuits, usually referred to as Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), is a promising prospect for near-term quantum computing. The QCNN is a circuit model inspired by the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are successful because they do not need manual feature design and can learn high-level features from raw data. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) builds on this success by learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, applying NAS to QCNNs presents unique challenges due to the lack of a well-defined search space. In this work, we propose a novel framework for representing QCNN architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search space design and architecture search. Using this framework, we generate a family of popular QCNNs, those resembling reverse binary trees. We then evaluate this family of models on a music genre classification dataset, GTZAN, to justify the importance of circuit architecture. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm to perform Quantum Phase Recognition (QPR) as an example of architecture search with our representation. This work provides a way to improve model performance without increasing complexity and to jump around the cost landscape to avoid barren plateaus. Finally, we implement the framework as an open-source Python package to enable dynamic QCNN creation and facilitate QCNN search space design for NAS.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

A popular approach to find networks under such requirements is through constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, previous methods use complicated predictors for the accuracy of the network. Those predictors are hard to interpret and sensitive to many hyperparameters to be tuned, hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated models is often harmed. In this work we resolve this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable Neural Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an accurate and simple bilinear formulation of both an accuracy estimator and the expected resource requirement, together with a scalable search method with theoretical guarantees. The simplicity of our proposed estimator together with the intuitive way it is constructed bring interpretability through many insights about the contribution of different design choices. For example, we find that in the examined search space, adding depth and width is more effective at deeper stages of the network and at the beginning of each resolution stage. Our experiments show that BINAS generates comparable to or better architectures than other state-of-the-art NAS methods within a reduced marginal search cost, while strictly satisfying the resource constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full code is released at https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/BINAS</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based NAS agent, named AlphaX, to tackle these two aspects. AlphaX improves the search efficiency by adaptively balancing the exploration and exploitation at the state level, and by a Meta-Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict network accuracies for biasing the search toward a promising region. To amortize the network evaluation cost, AlphaX accelerates MCTS rollouts with a distributed design and reduces the number of epochs in evaluating a network by transfer learning, which is guided with the tree structure in MCTS. In 12 GPU days and 1000 samples, AlphaX found an architecture that reaches 97.84\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10, and 75.5\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, exceeding SOTA NAS methods in both the accuracy and sampling efficiency. Particularly, we also evaluate AlphaX on NASBench-101, a large scale NAS dataset; AlphaX is 3x and 2.8x more sample efficient than Random Search and Regularized Evolution in finding the global optimum. Finally, we show the searched architecture improves a variety of vision applications from Neural Style Transfer, to Image Captioning and Object Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Thirty-Fourth AAAI conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2020)</p></details> |

However, the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture, because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work, we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space, in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are carefully determined. With the design, the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions, respectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy, performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversarial loss, thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaranteed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks, black-box attacks, and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the competitive accuracy, and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched, we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2212.14049</p></details> |

To achieve better generalization, we propose a novel neighborhood-aware NAS formulation to identify flat-minima architectures in the search space, with the assumption that flat minima generalize better than sharp minima. The phrase ``flat-minima architecture'' refers to architectures whose performance is stable under small perturbations in the architecture (e.g., replacing a convolution with a skip connection). Our formulation takes the ``flatness'' of an architecture into account by aggregating the performance over the neighborhood of this architecture. We demonstrate a principled way to apply our formulation to existing search algorithms, including sampling-based algorithms and gradient-based algorithms. To facilitate the application to gradient-based algorithms, we also propose a differentiable representation for the neighborhood of architectures. Based on our formulation, we propose neighborhood-aware random search (NA-RS) and neighborhood-aware differentiable architecture search (NA-DARTS). Notably, by simply augmenting DARTS with our formulation, NA-DARTS outperforms DARTS and achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.</p></details> | BMVC 2021 |

| **[Accuracy Prediction with Non-neural Model for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04785v3)** | 2021-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) with an accuracy predictor that predicts the accuracy of candidate architectures has drawn increasing attention due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Previous works usually employ neural network-based predictors which require more delicate design and are easy to overfit. Considering that most architectures are represented as sequences of discrete symbols which are more like tabular data and preferred by non-neural predictors, in this paper, we study an alternative approach which uses non-neural model for accuracy prediction. Specifically, as decision tree based models can better handle tabular data, we leverage gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) as the predictor for NAS. We demonstrate that the GBDT predictor can achieve comparable (if not better) prediction accuracy than neural network based predictors. Moreover, considering that a compact search space can ease the search process, we propose to prune the search space gradually according to important features derived from GBDT. In this way, NAS can be performed by first pruning the search space and then searching a neural architecture, which is more efficient and effective. Experiments on NASBench-101 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of using GBDT as predictor for NAS: (1) On NASBench-101, it is 22x, 8x, and 6x more sample efficient than random search, regularized evolution, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in finding the global optimum; (2) It achieves 24.2% top-1 error rate on ImageNet, and further achieves 23.4% top-1 error rate on ImageNet when enhanced with search space pruning.

Meanwhile, neural architecture search has become very popular in deep learning for automatically tuning the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural networks. While both federated learning and neural architecture search are faced with many open challenges, searching for optimized neural architectures in the federated learning framework is particularly demanding. This survey paper starts with a brief introduction to federated learning, including both horizontal, vertical, and hybrid federated learning. Then, neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and gradient-based are presented. This is followed by a description of federated neural architecture search that has recently been proposed, which is categorized into online and offline implementations, and single- and multi-objective search approaches. Finally, remaining open research questions are outlined and promising research topics are suggested.</p></details> |  |

Extending previous NAS techniques for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to CycleGAN is not straightforward due to the task difference and greater search space. We design architectures that consist of a stack of simple ResNet-based cells and develop a search method that effectively explore the large search space. We show that our framework, called CycleGANAS, not only effectively discovers high-performance architectures that either match or surpass the performance of the original CycleGAN, but also successfully address the data imbalance by individual architecture search for each translation direction. To our best knowledge, it is the first NAS result for CycleGAN and shed light on NAS for more complex structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSRNA: Differentiable Search of Robust Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06122v1)** | 2020-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep learning applications, the architectures of deep neural networks are crucial in achieving high accuracy. Many methods have been proposed to search for high-performance neural architectures automatically. However, these searched architectures are prone to adversarial attacks. A small perturbation of the input data can render the architecture to change prediction outcomes significantly. To address this problem, we propose methods to perform differentiable search of robust neural architectures. In our methods, two differentiable metrics are defined to measure architectures' robustness, based on certified lower bound and Jacobian norm bound. Then we search for robust architectures by maximizing the robustness metrics. Different from previous approaches which aim to improve architectures' robustness in an implicit way: performing adversarial training and injecting random noise, our methods explicitly and directly maximize robustness metrics to harvest robust architectures. On CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST, we perform game-based evaluation and verification-based evaluation on the robustness of our methods. The experimental results show that our methods 1) are more robust to various norm-bound attacks than several robust NAS baselines; 2) are more accurate than baselines when there are no attacks; 3) have significantly higher certified lower bounds than baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Network morphism, which keeps the functionality of a neural network while changing its neural architecture, could be helpful for NAS by enabling more efficient training during the search. In this paper, we propose a novel framework enabling Bayesian optimization to guide the network morphism for efficient neural architecture search. The framework develops a neural network kernel and a tree-structured acquisition function optimization algorithm to efficiently explores the search space. Intensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets have been done to demonstrate the superior performance of the developed framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we build an open-source AutoML system based on our method, namely Auto-Keras.

| **[Multi-fidelity Neural Architecture Search with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08341v2)** | 2021-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) targets at finding the optimal architecture of a neural network for a problem or a family of problems. Evaluations of neural architectures are very time-consuming. One of the possible ways to mitigate this issue is to use low-fidelity evaluations, namely training on a part of a dataset, fewer epochs, with fewer channels, etc. In this paper, we propose a bayesian multi-fidelity method for neural architecture search: MF-KD. The method relies on a new approach to low-fidelity evaluations of neural architectures by training for a few epochs using a knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation adds to a loss function a term forcing a network to mimic some teacher network. We carry out experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120. We show that training for a few epochs with such a modified loss function leads to a better selection of neural architectures than training for a few epochs with a logistic loss. The proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[NASIB: Neural Architecture Search withIn Budget](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08665v1)** | 2019-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) represents a class of methods to generate the optimal neural network architecture and typically iterate over candidate architectures till convergence over some particular metric like validation loss. They are constrained by the available computation resources, especially in enterprise environments. In this paper, we propose a new approach for NAS, called NASIB, which adapts and attunes to the computation resources (budget) available by varying the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off. We reduce the expert bias by searching over an augmented search space induced by Superkernels. The proposed method can provide the architecture search useful for different computation resources and different domains beyond image classification of natural images where we lack bespoke architecture motifs and domain expertise. We show, on CIFAR10, that itis possible to search over a space that comprises of 12x more candidate operations than the traditional prior art in just 1.5 GPU days, while reaching close to state of the art accuracy. While our method searches over an exponentially larger search space, it could lead to novel architectures that require lesser domain expertise, compared to the majority of the existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[NAS-BNN: Neural Architecture Search for Binary Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15484v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have gained extensive attention for their superior inferencing efficiency and compression ratio compared to traditional full-precision networks. However, due to the unique characteristics of BNNs, designing a powerful binary architecture is challenging and often requires significant manpower. A promising solution is to utilize Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to assist in designing BNNs, but current NAS methods for BNNs are relatively straightforward and leave a performance gap between the searched models and manually designed ones. To address this gap, we propose a novel neural architecture search scheme for binary neural networks, named NAS-BNN. We first carefully design a search space based on the unique characteristics of BNNs. Then, we present three training strategies, which significantly enhance the training of supernet and boost the performance of all subnets. Our discovered binary model family outperforms previous BNNs for a wide range of operations (OPs) from 20M to 200M. For instance, we achieve 68.20% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 57M OPs. In addition, we validate the transferability of these searched BNNs on the object detection task, and our binary detectors with the searched BNNs achieve a novel state-of-the-art result, e.g., 31.6% mAP with 370M OPs, on MS COCO dataset.

However, the search space is often extremely large. As a result, directly searching in such a large search space is non-trivial and also very time-consuming. To address the above issues, in each search step, we seek to limit the search space to a small but effective subspace to boost both the search performance and search efficiency. To this end, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search method via Dominative Subspace Mining (DSM-NAS) that finds promising architectures in automatically mined subspaces. Specifically, we first perform a global search, i.e ., dominative subspace mining, to find a good subspace from a set of candidates. Then, we perform a local search within the mined subspace to find effective architectures. More critically, we further boost search performance by taking well-designed/ searched architectures to initialize candidate subspaces. Experimental results demonstrate that DSM-NAS not only reduces the search cost but also discovers better architectures than state-of-the-art methods in various benchmark search spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Proximal Iterations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13577v3)** | 2019-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) recently attracts much research attention because of its ability to identify better architectures than handcrafted ones. However, many NAS methods, which optimize the search process in a discrete search space, need many GPU days for convergence. Recently, DARTS, which constructs a differentiable search space and then optimizes it by gradient descent, can obtain high-performance architecture and reduces the search time to several days. However, DARTS is still slow as it updates an ensemble of all operations and keeps only one after convergence. Besides, DARTS can converge to inferior architectures due to the strong correlation among operations. In this paper, we propose a new differentiable Neural Architecture Search method based on Proximal gradient descent (denoted as NASP). Different from DARTS, NASP reformulates the search process as an optimization problem with a constraint that only one operation is allowed to be updated during forward and backward propagation. Since the constraint is hard to deal with, we propose a new algorithm inspired by proximal iterations to solve it. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that NASP can obtain high-performance architectures with 10 times of speedup on the computational time than DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-2020</p></details> |

In addition to the fact that it presents a faster alternative to hand-designed architectures, it can improve their efficiency and for instance generate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) adapted for mobile devices. In this paper, we present a multi-objective neural architecture search method to find a family of CNN models with the best accuracy and computational resources tradeoffs, in a search space inspired by the state-of-the-art findings in neural search. Our work, called Dvolver, evolves a population of architectures and iteratively improves an approximation of the optimal Pareto front. Applying Dvolver on the model accuracy and on the number of floating points operations as objective functions, we are able to find, in only 2.5 days, a set of competitive mobile models on ImageNet. Amongst these models one architecture has the same Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet as NASNet-A mobile with 8% less floating point operations and another one has a Top-1 accuracy of 75.28% on ImageNet exceeding by 0.28% the best MobileNetV2 model for the same computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Improving the search efficiency and effectiveness have attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, few efforts have been devoted to understanding the generated architectures. In this paper, we first reveal that existing NAS algorithms (e.g., DARTS, ENAS) tend to favor architectures with wide and shallow cell structures. These favorable architectures consistently achieve fast convergence and are consequently selected by NAS algorithms. Our empirical and theoretical study further confirms that their fast convergence derives from their smooth loss landscape and accurate gradient information. Nonetheless, these architectures may not necessarily lead to better generalization performance compared with other candidate architectures in the same search space, and therefore further improvement is possible by revising existing NAS algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020</p></details> |

However, the structures and hyperparameters of deep neural network architectures also make huge difference on the performance in different tasks. The process of exploring optimal structures and hyperparameters often involves a lot of tedious human intervene. As a result, a legitimate question is to ask for the automation of searching for optimal network structures and hyperparameters. The work of automation of exploring optimal hyperparameters is done by Hyperparameter Optimization. Neural Architecture Search is aimed to automatically find the best network structure given specific tasks. In this paper, we firstly introduced the overall development of Neural Architecture Search and then focus mainly on providing an overall and understandable survey about Neural Architecture Search works that are relevant with reinforcement learning, including improvements and variants based on the hope of satisfying more complex structures and resource-insufficient environment.</p></details> |  |

Most existing works focus on a single task and design neural architectures manually, which are highly task-specific and hard to generalize to different tasks. In this paper, we devise a generalized deep multimodal neural architecture search (MMnas) framework for various multimodal learning tasks. Given multimodal input, we first define a set of primitive operations, and then construct a deep encoder-decoder based unified backbone, where each encoder or decoder block corresponds to an operation searched from a predefined operation pool. On top of the unified backbone, we attach task-specific heads to tackle different multimodal learning tasks. By using a gradient-based NAS algorithm, the optimal architectures for different tasks are learned efficiently. Extensive ablation studies, comprehensive analysis, and comparative experimental results show that the obtained MMnasNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across three multimodal learning tasks (over five datasets), including visual question answering, image-text matching, and visual grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACM MM2020, code available at https://github.com/MILVLG/mmnas/</p></details> |

Various algorithms have been proposed to improve the search efficiency and effectiveness of NAS, i.e., to reduce the search cost and improve the generalization performance of the selected architectures, respectively. However, the search efficiency of these algorithms is severely limited by the need for model training during the search process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel NAS algorithm called NAS at Initialization (NASI) that exploits the capability of a Neural Tangent Kernel in being able to characterize the converged performance of candidate architectures at initialization, hence allowing model training to be completely avoided to boost the search efficiency. Besides the improved search efficiency, NASI also achieves competitive search effectiveness on various datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Further, NASI is shown to be label- and data-agnostic under mild conditions, which guarantees the transferability of architectures selected by our NASI over different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Neural Predictor for Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00848v1)** | 2019-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search methods are effective but often use complex algorithms to come up with the best architecture. We propose an approach with three basic steps that is conceptually much simpler. First we train N random architectures to generate N (architecture, validation accuracy) pairs and use them to train a regression model that predicts accuracy based on the architecture. Next, we use this regression model to predict the validation accuracies of a large number of random architectures. Finally, we train the top-K predicted architectures and deploy the model with the best validation result. While this approach seems simple, it is more than 20 times as sample efficient as Regularized Evolution on the NASBench-101 benchmark and can compete on ImageNet with more complex approaches based on weight sharing, such as ProxylessNAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DC-NAS: Divide-and-Conquer Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14456v1)** | 2020-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most applications demand high-performance deep neural architectures costing limited resources. Neural architecture searching is a way of automatically exploring optimal deep neural networks in a given huge search space. However, all sub-networks are usually evaluated using the same criterion; that is, early stopping on a small proportion of the training dataset, which is an inaccurate and highly complex approach. In contrast to conventional methods, here we present a divide-and-conquer (DC) approach to effectively and efficiently search deep neural architectures. Given an arbitrary search space, we first extract feature representations of all sub-networks according to changes in parameters or output features of each layer, and then calculate the similarity between two different sampled networks based on the representations. Then, a k-means clustering is conducted to aggregate similar architectures into the same cluster, separately executing sub-network evaluation in each cluster. The best architecture in each cluster is later merged to obtain the optimal neural architecture. Experimental results conducted on several benchmarks illustrate that DC-NAS can overcome the inaccurate evaluation problem, achieving a $75.1\%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, which is higher than that of state-of-the-art methods using the same search space.</p></details> |  |

Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm capitalizes on the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for image representations, which is an increasingly crucial topic of computer vision. First, using only a small amount of unlabeled train data under contrastive self-supervised learning allow us to search on a more extensive search space, discovering better neural architectures without surging the computational resources. Second, we entirely relieve the cost for labeled data (by contrastive loss) in the search stage without compromising architectures' final performance in the evaluation phase. Finally, we tackle the inherent discrete search space of the NAS problem by sequential model-based optimization via the tree-parzen estimator (SMBO-TPE), enabling us to reduce the computational expense response surface significantly. An extensive number of experiments empirically show that our search algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results with better efficiency in data labeling cost, searching time, and accuracy in final validation.</p></details> |  |

This approach applies continuous relaxation of network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However, performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness. To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2024, paper + supplementary, 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-channel DART Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09170v1)** | 2020-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomography deals with the reconstruction of objects from their projections, acquired along a range of angles. Discrete tomography is concerned with objects that consist of a small number of materials, which makes it possible to compute accurate reconstructions from highly limited projection data. For cases where the allowed intensity values in the reconstruction are known a priori, the discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) has shown to yield accurate reconstructions from few projections. However, a key limitation is that the benefit of DART diminishes as the number of different materials increases. Many tomographic imaging techniques can simultaneously record tomographic data at multiple channels, each corresponding to a different weighting of the materials in the object. Whenever projection data from more than one channel is available, this additional information can potentially be exploited by the reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we present Multi-Channel DART (MC-DART), which deals effectively with multi-channel data. This class of algorithms is a generalization of DART to multiple channels and combines the information for each separate channel-reconstruction in a multi-channel segmentation step. We demonstrate that in a range of simulation experiments, MC-DART is capable of producing more accurate reconstructions compared to single-channel DART.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. 17 figures.

| **[Fine-Tuning DARTS for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09042v1)** | 2020-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained attraction due to superior classification performance. Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) is a computationally light method. To limit computational resources DARTS makes numerous approximations. These approximations result in inferior performance. We propose to fine-tune DARTS using fixed operations as they are independent of these approximations. Our method offers a good trade-off between the number of parameters and classification accuracy. Our approach improves the top-1 accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, CompCars, and MIO-TCD datasets by 0.56%, 0.50%, and 0.39%, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our approach performs better than DARTS, improving the accuracy by 0.28%, 1.64%, 0.34%, 4.5%, and 3.27% compared to DARTS, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion-MNIST, CompCars, and MIO-TCD datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[G-DARTS-A: Groups of Channel Parallel Sampling with Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08360v1)** | 2020-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) provides a baseline for searching effective network architectures based gradient, but it is accompanied by huge computational overhead in searching and training network architecture. Recently, many novel works have improved DARTS. Particularly, Partially-Connected DARTS(PC-DARTS) proposed the partial channel sampling technique which achieved good results. In this work, we found that the backbone provided by DARTS is prone to overfitting. To mitigate this problem, we propose an approach named Group-DARTS with Attention (G-DARTS-A), using multiple groups of channels for searching. Inspired by the partially sampling strategy of PC-DARTS, we use groups channels to sample the super-network to perform a more efficient search while maintaining the relative integrity of the network information. In order to relieve the competition between channel groups and keep channel balance, we follow the attention mechanism in Squeeze-and-Excitation Network. Each group of channels shares defined weights thence they can provide different suggestion for searching. The searched architecture is more powerful and better adapted to different deployments. Specifically, by only using the attention module on DARTS we achieved an error rate of 2.82%/16.36% on CIFAR10/100 with 0.3GPU-days for search process on CIFAR10. Apply our G-DARTS-A to DARTS/PC-DARTS, an error rate of 2.57%/2.61% on CIFAR10 with 0.5/0.4 GPU-days is achieved.</p></details> |  |

A k-d dart is a set of independent, mutually orthogonal, k-dimensional subspaces called k-d flats. Each dart has d choose k flats, aligned with the coordinate axes for efficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's properties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a threshold. We describe a recipe for converting an algorithm from point sampling to k-d dart sampling, assuming the function can be evaluated along a k-d flat. We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in high dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g. the subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a flat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line darts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality rasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of failure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these applications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in less time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a volume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less memory, enabling the generation of larger point clouds in higher dimensions.</p></details> | 19 pages 16 figures |

A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $ω^2$ where $ω$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of DARTS is often observed to collapse when the number of search epochs becomes large. Meanwhile, lots of "{\em skip-connect}s" are found in the selected architectures. In this paper, we claim that the cause of the collapse is that there exists overfitting in the optimization of DARTS. Therefore, we propose a simple and effective algorithm, named "DARTS+", to avoid the collapse and improve the original DARTS, by "early stopping" the search procedure when meeting a certain criterion. We also conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and different search spaces and show the effectiveness of our DARTS+ algorithm, and DARTS+ achieves $2.32\%$ test error on CIFAR10, $14.87\%$ on CIFAR100, and $23.7\%$ on ImageNet. We further remark that the idea of "early stopping" is implicitly included in some existing DARTS variants by manually setting a small number of search epochs, while we give an {\em explicit} criterion for "early stopping".</p></details> |  |

While modern weight-sharing NAS methods such as DARTS are able to finish the search in single-digit GPU days, extracting the final best architecture from the shared weights is notoriously unreliable. Training-Speed-Estimate (TSE), a recently developed generalization estimator with a Bayesian marginal likelihood interpretation, has previously been used in place of the validation loss for gradient-based optimization in DARTS. This prevents the DARTS skip connection collapse, which significantly improves performance on NASBench-201 and the original DARTS search space. We extend those results by applying various DARTS diagnostics and show several unusual behaviors arising from not using a validation set. Furthermore, our experiments yield concrete examples of the depth gap and topology selection in DARTS having a strongly negative impact on the search performance despite generally receiving limited attention in the literature compared to the operations selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 5th Workshop on Meta-Learning at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |

Our goal was to design a small-scale car-like robot equipped with all the hardware needed for on-board navigation and control while keeping it cost-effective and easy to replicate. To develop DART, we built on an existing off-the-shelf model and augmented its sensor suite to improve its capabilities for control and motion planning tasks. We detail the hardware setup and the system identification challenges to derive the vehicle's models. Furthermore, we present some use cases where we used DART to test different motion planning applications to show the versatility of the platform.

However, DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the architecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization, Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective method will give some insights on differential architecture search.

It has attracted significant attentions in Auto-ML research and becomes one of the most useful paradigms in NAS. Although DARTS can produce superior efficiency over traditional NAS approaches with better control of complex parameters, oftentimes it suffers from stabilization issues in producing deteriorating architectures when discretizing the continuous architecture. We observed considerable loss of validity causing dramatic decline in performance at this final discretization step of DARTS. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Shift based DARTS (MS-DARTS) to improve stability based on sampling and perturbation. Our approach can improve bot the stability and accuracy of DARTS, by smoothing the loss landscape and sampling architecture parameters within a suitable bandwidth. We investigate the convergence of our mean-shift approach, together with the effects of bandwidth selection that affects stability and accuracy. Evaluations performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that MS-DARTS archives higher performance over other state-of-the-art NAS methods with reduced search cost.</p></details> | 14pages |

Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS.

They are trained by denoising a Markovian process which gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Considering almost one year of tournament data, corresponding to 167,492 dart throws in total, we use state-space models to investigate serial dependence in throwing performance. In our models, a latent state process serves as a proxy for a player's underlying ability, and we use autoregressive processes to model how this process evolves over time. We find a strong but short-lived serial dependence in the latent state process, thus providing evidence for the existence of the hot hand.</p></details> |  |

In comparison, discretization offers an easy alternative, with all operations having linear-time complexity in the number of clocks, and yet valid for a large class of closed systems. Unfortunately, fine-grained discretization causes itself a state-space explosion. We introduce a new data structure called time-darts for the symbolic representation of state-spaces of timed automata. Compared with the complete discretization, a single time-dart allows to represent an arbitrary large set of states, yet the time complexity of operations on time-darts remain linear in the number of clocks. We prove the correctness of the suggested reachability algorithm and perform several experiments in order to compare the performance of time-darts and the complete discretization. The main conclusion is that in all our experiments the time-dart method outperforms the complete discretization and it scales significantly better for models with larger constants.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings SSV 2012, arXiv:1211.5873</p></details> |

Data-to-Text annotations can be a costly process, especially when dealing with tables which are the major source of structured data and contain nontrivial structures. To this end, we propose a procedure of extracting semantic triples from tables that encodes their structures by exploiting the semantic dependencies among table headers and the table title. Our dataset construction framework effectively merged heterogeneous sources from open domain semantic parsing and dialogue-act-based meaning representation tasks by utilizing techniques such as: tree ontology annotation, question-answer pair to declarative sentence conversion, and predicate unification, all with minimum post-editing. We present systematic evaluation on DART as well as new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG 2017 to show that DART (1) poses new challenges to existing data-to-text datasets and (2) facilitates out-of-domain generalization.

| **[$Λ$-DARTS: Mitigating Performance Collapse by Harmonizing Operation Selection among Cells](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07998v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($Λ$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Due to its success, numerous variants analyzing and improving parts of the DARTS framework have recently been proposed. By considering the problem as a constrained bilevel optimization, we present and analyze DARTS-PRIME, a variant including improvements to architectural weight update scheduling and regularization towards discretization. We propose a dynamic schedule based on per-minibatch network information to make architecture updates more informed, as well as proximity regularization to promote well-separated discretization. Our results in multiple domains show that DARTS-PRIME improves both performance and reliability, comparable to state-of-the-art in differentiable NAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Noise Injection for Robust Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09327v2)** | 2018-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One approach to Imitation Learning is Behavior Cloning, in which a robot observes a supervisor and infers a control policy. A known problem with this "off-policy" approach is that the robot's errors compound when drifting away from the supervisor's demonstrations. On-policy, techniques alleviate this by iteratively collecting corrective actions for the current robot policy. However, these techniques can be tedious for human supervisors, add significant computation burden, and may visit dangerous states during training. We propose an off-policy approach that injects noise into the supervisor's policy while demonstrating. This forces the supervisor to demonstrate how to recover from errors. We propose a new algorithm, DART (Disturbances for Augmenting Robot Trajectories), that collects demonstrations with injected noise, and optimizes the noise level to approximate the error of the robot's trained policy during data collection. We compare DART with DAgger and Behavior Cloning in two domains: in simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo tasks (Walker, Humanoid, Hopper, Half-Cheetah) and in physical experiments with human supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter. For high dimensional tasks like Humanoid, DART can be up to $3x$ faster in computation time and only decreases the supervisor's cumulative reward by $5\%$ during training, whereas DAgger executes policies that have $80\%$ less cumulative reward than the supervisor. On the grasping in clutter task, DART obtains on average a $62\%$ performance increase over Behavior Cloning.</p></details> |  |

So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing models focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the origin of AIGT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

The DART descriptor is applied to four different problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching: (1) The DART features are directly employed as local descriptors in a bag-of-features classification framework and testing is carried out on four standard event-based object datasets (N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, CIFAR10-DVS, NCaltech-101). (2) Extending the classification system, tracking is demonstrated using two key novelties: (i) For overcoming the low-sample problem for the one-shot learning of a binary classifier, statistical bootstrapping is leveraged with online learning; (ii) To achieve tracker robustness, the scale and rotation equivariance property of the DART descriptors is exploited for the one-shot learning. (3) To solve the long-term object tracking problem, an object detector is designed using the principle of cluster majority voting. The detection scheme is then combined with the tracker to result in a high intersection-over-union score with augmented ground truth annotations on the publicly available event camera dataset. (4) Finally, the event context encoded by DART greatly simplifies the feature correspondence problem, especially for spatio-temporal slices far apart in time, which has not been explicitly tackled in the event-based vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, revision submitted to TPAMI in Nov 2018</p></details> |
| **[MSR-DARTS: Minimum Stable Rank of Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09209v2)** | 2021-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In neural architecture search (NAS), differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has recently attracted much attention due to its high efficiency. It defines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which represents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the network and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method finds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a model with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the resulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we propose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a model with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization with the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion. Specifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS selects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M parameters within 0.3 GPU-days on CIFAR-10, and a top-1 error rate of 23.9% on ImageNet. The official code is available at https://github.com/mtaecchhi/msrdarts.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[iDARTS: Improving DARTS by Node Normalization and Decorrelation Discretization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11014v1)** | 2021-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) uses a continuous relaxation of network representation and dramatically accelerates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by almost thousands of times in GPU-day. However, the searching process of DARTS is unstable, which suffers severe degradation when training epochs become large, thus limiting its application. In this paper, we claim that this degradation issue is caused by the imbalanced norms between different nodes and the highly correlated outputs from various operations. We then propose an improved version of DARTS, namely iDARTS, to deal with the two problems. In the training phase, it introduces node normalization to maintain the norm balance. In the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based on the similarity between the outputs of the node and the decorrelated operations rather than the values of the architecture parameters. Extensive evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and the error rates of 2.25\% and 24.7\% are reported within 0.2 and 1.9 GPU-day for architecture search respectively, which shows its effectiveness. Additional analysis also reveals that iDARTS has the advantage in robustness and generalization over other DARTS-based counterparts.</p></details> |  |

It drastically reduces search cost by resorting to weight-sharing. However, it also dramatically reduces the search space, thus excluding potential promising architectures. In this article, we propose D-DARTS, a solution that addresses this problem by nesting neural networks at the cell level instead of using weight-sharing to produce more diversified and specialized architectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm that can derive deeper architectures from a few trained cells, increasing performance and saving computation time. In addition, we also present an alternative search space (DARTOpti) in which we optimize existing handcrafted architectures (e.g., ResNet) rather than starting from scratch. This approach is accompanied by a novel metric that measures the distance between architectures inside our custom search space. Our solution reaches competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks.

Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |

However, it suffers an issue which we call over-specialization, wherein trees added at later iterations tend to impact the prediction of only a few instances, and make negligible contribution towards the remaining instances. This negatively affects the performance of the model on unseen data, and also makes the model over-sensitive to the contributions of the few, initially added tress. We show that the commonly used tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains. In this work, we explore a different approach to address the problem that of employing dropouts, a tool that has been recently proposed in the context of learning deep neural networks. We propose a novel way of employing dropouts in MART, resulting in the DART algorithm. We evaluate DART on ranking, regression and classification tasks, using large scale, publicly available datasets, and show that DART outperforms MART in each of the tasks, with a significant margin. We also show that DART overcomes the issue of over-specialization to a considerable extent.</p></details> | AIStats 2015 |

Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant performance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without extra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stretchable Cells Help DARTS Search Better](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.09300v2)** | 2022-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) has gained much success in discovering flexible and diverse cell types. To reduce the evaluation gap, the supernet is expected to have identical layers with the target network. However, even for this consistent search, the searched cells often suffer from poor performance, especially for the supernet with fewer layers, as current DARTS methods are prone to wide and shallow cells, and this topology collapse induces sub-optimal searched cells. In this paper, we alleviate this issue by endowing the cells with explicit stretchability, so the search can be directly implemented on our stretchable cells for both operation type and topology simultaneously. Concretely, we introduce a set of topological variables and a combinatorial probabilistic distribution to explicitly model the target topology. With more diverse and complex topologies, our method adapts well for various layer numbers. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that our stretchable cells obtain better performance with fewer layers and parameters. For example, our method can improve DARTS by 0.28\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset with 45\% parameters reduced or 2.9\% with similar FLOPs on ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $α$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $β$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CCBR 2024</p></details> |

While real-world data collection effort exist, requirements for robot hardware, physical environment setups, and frequent resets significantly impede the scalability needed for modern learning frameworks. We introduce DART, a teleoperation platform designed for crowdsourcing that reimagines robotic data collection by leveraging cloud-based simulation and augmented reality (AR) to address many limitations of prior data collection efforts. Our user studies highlight that DART enables higher data collection throughput and lower physical fatigue compared to real-world teleoperation. We also demonstrate that policies trained using DART-collected datasets successfully transfer to reality and are robust to unseen visual disturbances. All data collected through DART is automatically stored in our cloud-hosted database, DexHub, which will be made publicly available upon curation, paving the path for DexHub to become an ever-growing data hub for robot learning.

| **[DeepDarts: Modeling Keypoints as Objects for Automatic Scorekeeping in Darts using a Single Camera](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09880v1)** | 2021-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts. Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data (830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive DARTS: Bridging the Optimization Gap for NAS in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10952v2)** | 2020-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of neural architecture search (NAS), researchers found powerful network architectures for a wide range of vision tasks. However, it remains unclear if the searched architecture can transfer across different types of tasks as manually designed ones did. This paper puts forward this problem, referred to as NAS in the wild, which explores the possibility of finding the optimal architecture in a proxy dataset and then deploying it to mostly unseen scenarios. We instantiate this setting using a currently popular algorithm named differentiable architecture search (DARTS), which often suffers unsatisfying performance while being transferred across different tasks. We argue that the accuracy drop originates from the formulation that uses a super-network for search but a sub-network for re-training. The different properties of these stages have resulted in a significant optimization gap, and consequently, the architectural parameters "over-fit" the super-network. To alleviate the gap, we present a progressive method that gradually increases the network depth during the search stage, which leads to the Progressive DARTS (P-DARTS) algorithm. With a reduced search cost (7 hours on a single GPU), P-DARTS achieves improved performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10) and a few target problems (ImageNet classification, COCO detection and three ReID benchmarks). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/chenxin061/pdarts}.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extension of P-DARTS. Previous version: arXiv:1904.12760</p></details> |

Solving the Game of Darts as a Dynamic Zero-Sum Game](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11031v2)** | 2022-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The game of darts has enjoyed great growth over the past decade with the perception of darts moving from that of a pub game to a game that is regularly scheduled on prime-time television in many countries including the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia among others. The game of darts involves strategic interactions between two players but to date the literature has ignored these interactions. In this paper, we formulate and solve the game of darts as a dynamic zero-sum-game (ZSG), and to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so. We also estimate individual skill models using a novel data-set based on darts matches that were played by the top 16 professional players in the world during the 2019 season. Using the fitted skill models and our ZSG problem formulation, we quantify the importance of playing strategically, i.e. taking into account the score and strategy of one's opponent, when computing an optimal strategy. For top professionals we find that playing strategically results in an increase in win-probability of just 0.2% - 0.6% over a single leg but as much as 2.3% over a best-of-35 legs match.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART$^3$: Leveraging Distance for Test Time Adaptation in Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18337v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias, where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under (inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID, thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.</p></details> |  |

However, current differentiable NAS methods often face constraints in efficiency, operation selection, and adaptability under varying resource limitations. We introduce ZO-DARTS++, a novel NAS method that effectively balances performance and resource constraints. By integrating a zeroth-order approximation for efficient gradient handling, employing a sparsemax function with temperature annealing for clearer and more interpretable architecture distributions, and adopting a size-variable search scheme for generating compact yet accurate architectures, ZO-DARTS++ establishes a new balance between model complexity and performance. In extensive tests on medical imaging datasets, ZO-DARTS++ improves the average accuracy by up to 1.8\% over standard DARTS-based methods and shortens search time by approximately 38.6\%. Additionally, its resource-constrained variants can reduce the number of parameters by more than 35\% while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Thus, ZO-DARTS++ offers a versatile and efficient framework for generating high-quality, resource-aware DL models suitable for real-world medical applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Stabilizing DARTS with Amended Gradient Estimation on Architectural Parameters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11831v5)** | 2020-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DARTS is a popular algorithm for neural architecture search (NAS). Despite its great advantage in search efficiency, DARTS often suffers weak stability, which reflects in the large variation among individual trials as well as the sensitivity to the hyper-parameters of the search process. This paper owes such instability to an optimization gap between the super-network and its sub-networks, namely, improving the validation accuracy of the super-network does not necessarily lead to a higher expectation on the performance of the sampled sub-networks. Then, we point out that the gap is due to the inaccurate estimation of the architectural gradients, based on which we propose an amended estimation method. Mathematically, our method guarantees a bounded error from the true gradients while the original estimation does not. Our approach bridges the gap from two aspects, namely, amending the estimation on the architectural gradients, and unifying the hyper-parameter settings in the search and re-training stages. Experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach largely improves search stability and, more importantly, enables DARTS-based approaches to explore much larger search spaces that have not been investigated before.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2020, updated experiments on Penn Treebank</p></details> |

To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) > 20 and orbital period < 50 days.</p></details> | <details><summary>Numbe...</summary><p>Number of pages: 24, Number of figures: 8, Article accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal on 2025-05-30</p></details> |
| **[$α$ DARTS Once More: Enhancing Differentiable Architecture Search by Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10105v1)** | 2022-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely $α$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex manual-designed strategies.</p></details> |  |

NAS has outperformed hand-designed networks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the design of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human expertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task, leaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked. Generally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel task. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or transferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no performance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a meta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search (DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred architecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity measure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as transfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better. Additionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned over multiple tasks. Experiments show that warm-started DARTS is able to find competitive performing architectures while reducing searching costs on average by 60%.</p></details> |  |

However, simulating realistic radar scans is a challenging task that requires an accurate model of the scene, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Rather than specifying these models explicitly, we propose DART - Doppler Aided Radar Tomography, a Neural Radiance Field-inspired method which uses radar-specific physics to create a reflectance and transmittance-based rendering pipeline for range-Doppler images. We then evaluate DART by constructing a custom data collection platform and collecting a novel radar dataset together with accurate position and instantaneous velocity measurements from lidar-based localization. In comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, DART synthesizes superior radar range-Doppler images from novel views across all datasets and additionally can be used to generate high quality tomographic images.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024; see https://wiselabcmu.github.io/dart/ for our project site</p></details> |

However, the design of successful model architecture has always relied on human experience and intuition. Besides, many hyperparameters related to model architecture need to be manually tuned. Therefore in this paper, we propose an ASR approach with efficient gradient-based architecture search, DARTS-ASR. In order to examine the generalizability of DARTS-ASR, we apply our approach not only on many languages to perform monolingual ASR, but also on a multilingual ASR setting. Following previous works, we conducted experiments on a multilingual dataset, IARPA BABEL. The experiment results show that our approach outperformed the baseline fixed-topology architecture by 10.2% and 10.0% relative reduction on character error rates under monolingual and multilingual ASR settings respectively. Furthermore, we perform some analysis on the searched architectures by DARTS-ASR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2020</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely, Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-network to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We alleviate it using edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoys both faster speed and higher training stability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 with merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) using 3.8 GPU-days for search.

However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

| **[DARTS-: Robustly Stepping out of Performance Collapse Without Indicators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01027v2)** | 2021-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the fast development of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), it suffers from long-standing performance instability, which extremely limits its application. Existing robustifying methods draw clues from the resulting deteriorated behavior instead of finding out its causing factor. Various indicators such as Hessian eigenvalues are proposed as a signal to stop searching before the performance collapses. However, these indicator-based methods tend to easily reject good architectures if the thresholds are inappropriately set, let alone the searching is intrinsically noisy. In this paper, we undertake a more subtle and direct approach to resolve the collapse. We first demonstrate that skip connections have a clear advantage over other candidate operations, where it can easily recover from a disadvantageous state and become dominant. We conjecture that this privilege is causing degenerated performance. Therefore, we propose to factor out this benefit with an auxiliary skip connection, ensuring a fairer competition for all operations. We call this approach DARTS-. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify that it can substantially improve robustness.

In arrhythmia detection, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an important diagnostic technique. However, manually evaluating ECG signals is a complicated and time-consuming task. With the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the evaluation process has been accelerated and the performance is improved. It is noteworthy that the performance of CNNs heavily depends on their architecture design, which is a complex process grounded on expert experience and trial-and-error. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Heart-Darts, to efficiently classify the ECG signals by automatically designing the CNN model with the differentiable architecture search (i.e., Darts, a cell-based neural architecture search method). Specifically, we initially search a cell architecture by Darts and then customize a novel CNN model for ECG classification based on the obtained cells. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed method, we evaluate the constructed model on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Additionally, the extensibility of the proposed CNN model is validated on two other new databases. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art CNN models in ECG classification in terms of both performance and generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

However, the network performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub: https://github.com/PRAISELab-PicusLab/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: A Principled Approach to Adversarially Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11120v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts and adversarial examples are two major challenges for deploying machine learning models. While these challenges have been studied individually, their combination is an important topic that remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study the problem of adversarial robustness under a common setting of distribution shift - unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, given a labeled source domain $D_S$ and an unlabeled target domain $D_T$ with related but different distributions, the goal is to obtain an adversarially robust model for $D_T$. The absence of target domain labels poses a unique challenge, as conventional adversarial robustness defenses cannot be directly applied to $D_T$. To address this challenge, we first establish a generalization bound for the adversarial target loss, which consists of (i) terms related to the loss on the data, and (ii) a measure of worst-case domain divergence. Motivated by this bound, we develop a novel unified defense framework called Divergence Aware adveRsarial Training (DART), which can be used in conjunction with a variety of standard UDA methods; e.g., DANN [Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015]. DART is applicable to general threat models, including the popular $\ell_p$-norm model, and does not require heuristic regularizers or architectural changes. We also release DomainRobust: a testbed for evaluating robustness of UDA models to adversarial attacks. DomainRobust consists of 4 multi-domain benchmark datasets (with 46 source-target pairs) and 7 meta-algorithms with a total of 11 variants. Our large-scale experiments demonstrate that on average, DART significantly enhances model robustness on all benchmarks compared to the state of the art, while maintaining competitive standard accuracy. The relative improvement in robustness from DART reaches up to 29.2% on the source-target domain pairs considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[RC-DARTS: Resource Constrained Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12814v1)** | 2020-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances show that Neural Architectural Search (NAS) method is able to find state-of-the-art image classification deep architectures. In this paper, we consider the one-shot NAS problem for resource constrained applications. This problem is of great interest because it is critical to choose different architectures according to task complexity when the resource is constrained. Previous techniques are either too slow for one-shot learning or does not take the resource constraint into consideration. In this paper, we propose the resource constrained differentiable architecture search (RC-DARTS) method to learn architectures that are significantly smaller and faster while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we propose to formulate the RC-DARTS task as a constrained optimization problem by adding the resource constraint. An iterative projection method is proposed to solve the given constrained optimization problem. We also propose a multi-level search strategy to enable layers at different depths to adaptively learn different types of neural architectures. Through extensive experiments on the Cifar10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that the RC-DARTS method learns lightweight neural architectures which have smaller model size and lower computational complexity while achieving comparable or better performances than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[DART-Math: Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning for Mathematical Problem-Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13690v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving mathematical problems requires advanced reasoning abilities and presents notable challenges for large language models. Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries. Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we propose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4. We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called DART-MATH. In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, DART-MATH outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

The reward can be a non-linear function of the rewards of the selected individual arms. The direct use of a multi-armed bandit algorithm requires choosing among $\binom{N}{K}$ options, making the action space large. To simplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits {typically} assume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we prove the lower bound for top-$K$ subset selection with bandit feedback with possibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial setting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the reward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of individual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially finds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is computationally efficient and uses storage linear in $N$. Further, DART achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K\sqrt{KNT})$ for a time horizon $T$, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of $\sqrt{\log{2NT}}$. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization and maximizing the mean of individual rewards, the performance of the proposed algorithm surpasses that of state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that DART significantly outperforms existing methods for both linear and non-linear joint reward environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[$β$-DARTS++: Bi-level Regularization for Proxy-robust Differentiable Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06393v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (i.e., $β$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $β$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $β$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665</p></details> |
| **[Applicability of oculomics for individual risk prediction: Repeatability and robustness of retinal Fractal Dimension using DART and AutoMorph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06950v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To investigate whether Fractal Dimension (FD)-based oculomics could be used for individual risk prediction by evaluating repeatability and robustness. Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter λ which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median λ in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with λ (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning Truncation for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01170v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised \textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Bayes Approach for Estimating Skill Models for Professional Darts Players](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10750v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform an exploratory data analysis on a data-set for the top 16 professional darts players from the 2019 season. We use this data-set to fit player skill models which can then be used in dynamic zero-sum games (ZSGs) that model real-world matches between players. We propose an empirical Bayesian approach based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) model that overcomes limitations in the data. Specifically we introduce two DM-based skill models where the first model borrows strength from other darts players and the second model borrows strength from other regions of the dartboard. We find these DM-based models outperform simpler benchmark models with respect to Brier and Spherical scores, both of which are proper scoring rules. We also show in ZSGs settings that the difference between DM-based skill models and the simpler benchmark models is practically significant. Finally, we use our DM-model to analyze specific situations that arose in real-world darts matches during the 2019 season.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.11031</p></details> |
| **[FX-DARTS: Designing Topology-unconstrained Architectures with Differentiable Architecture Search and Entropy-based Super-network Shrinking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20079v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |

In ASR field especially end-to-end ASR, the related research is still in its infancy. In this work, we focus on applying NAS on the most popular manually designed model: Conformer, and then propose an efficient ASR model searching method that benefits from the natural advantage of differentiable architecture search (Darts) in reducing computational overheads. We fuse Darts mutator and Conformer blocks to form a complete search space, within which a modified architecture called Darts-Conformer cell is found automatically. The entire searching process on AISHELL-1 dataset costs only 0.7 GPU days. Replacing the Conformer encoder by stacking searched cell, we get an end-to-end ASR model (named as Darts-Conformner) that outperforms the Conformer baseline by 4.7\% on the open-source AISHELL-1 dataset. Besides, we verify the transferability of the architecture searched on a small dataset to a larger 2k-hour dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to apply gradient-based architecture search in the attention-based encoder-decoder ASR model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASRU 2021</p></details> |
| **[DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05585v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART) framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

We present a blue noise sampling method with good quality and performance across different dimensions. The method, spoke-dart sampling, shoots rays from prior samples and selects samples from these rays. It combines the advantages of two major high-dimensional sampling methods: the locality of advancing front with the dimensionality-reduction of hyperplanes, specifically line sampling. We prove that the output sampling is saturated with high probability, with bounds on distances between pairs of samples and between any domain point and its nearest sample. We demonstrate spoke-dart applications for approximate Delaunay graph construction, global optimization, and robotic motion planning. Both the blue-noise quality of the output distribution and the adaptability of the intermediate processes of our method are useful in these applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Maximum Weight Independent Sets in Odd-Hole-Free Graphs Without Dart or Without Bull](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.2512v1)** | 2012-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) Problem on graphs with vertex weights asks for a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices of maximum total weight. Being one of the most investigated and most important problems on graphs, it is well known to be NP-complete and hard to approximate. The complexity of MWIS is open for hole-free graphs (i.e., graphs without induced subgraphs isomorphic to a chordless cycle of length at least five). By applying clique separator decomposition as well as modular decomposition, we obtain polynomial time solutions of MWIS for odd-hole- and dart-free graphs as well as for odd-hole- and bull-free graphs (dart and bull have five vertices, say $a,b,c,d,e$, and dart has edges $ab,ac,ad,bd,cd,de$, while bull has edges $ab,bc,cd,be,ce$). If the graphs are hole-free instead of odd-hole-free then stronger structural results and better time bounds are obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dart: Divide and Specialize for Fast Response to Congestion in RDMA-based Datacenter Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11158v2)** | 2020-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) promises to reduce datacenter network latencies significantly compared to TCP (e.g., 10x), end-to-end congestion control in the presence of incasts is a challenge. Targeting the full generality of the congestion problem, previous schemes rely on slow, iterative convergence to the appropriate sending rates (e.g., TIMELY takes 50 RTTs). Several papers have shown that even in oversubscribed datacenter networks most congestion occurs at the receiver. Accordingly, we propose a divide-and-specialize approach, called Dart, which isolates the common case of receiver congestion and further subdivides the remaining in-network congestion into the simpler spatially-localized and the harder spatially-dispersed cases. For receiver congestion, we propose direct apportioning of sending rates (DASR) in which a receiver for n senders directs each sender to cut its rate by a factor of n, converging in only one RTT. For the spatially-localized case, Dart provides fast (under one RTT) response by adding novel switch hardware for in-order flow deflection (IOFD) because RDMA disallows packet reordering on which previous load balancing schemes rely. For the uncommon spatially-dispersed case, Dart falls back to DCQCN. Small-scale testbed measurements and at-scale simulations, respectively, show that Dart achieves 60% (2.5x) and 79% (4.8x) lower 99th-percentile latency, and similar and 58% higher throughput than InfiniBand, and TIMELY and DCQCN.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |

This paper introduces DART-LLM, a novel framework that employs Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies, enabling the decomposition of natural language instructions into well-coordinated subtasks for multi-robot execution. DART-LLM comprises four key components: a Question-Answering (QA) LLM module for dependency-aware task decomposition, a Breakdown Function module for robot assignment, an Actuation module for execution, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detector for environmental perception, achieving end-to-end task execution. Experimental results across three task complexity levels demonstrate that DART-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming the baseline across all evaluation metrics. Among the tested models, DeepSeek-r1-671B achieves the highest success rate, whereas Llama-3.1-8B exhibits superior response time reliability. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit dependency modeling notably enhances the performance of smaller models, facilitating efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

| **[Evaluating Effectiveness of DART Buoy Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02795v1)** | 2016-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A performance measure for a DART tsunami buoy network has been developed. The measure is based on a statistical analysis of simulated forecasts of wave heights outside an impact site and how much the forecasts are degraded in accuracy when one or more buoys are inoperative. The analysis uses simulated tsunami height time series collected at each buoy from selected source segments in the Short-term Inundation Forecast for Tsunamis (SIFT) database and involves a set for 1000 forecasts for each buoy/segment pair at sites just offshore of selected impact communities. Random error-producing scatter in the time series is induced by uncertainties in the source location, addition of real oceanic noise, and imperfect tidal removal. Comparison with an error-free standard leads to root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for DART buoys located near a subduction zone. The RMSEs indicate which buoy provides the best forecast (lowest RMSE) for sections of the zone, under a warning-time constraint for the forecasts of 3 hrs. The analysis also shows how the forecasts are degraded (larger minimum RMSE among the remaining buoys) when one or more buoys become inoperative. The RMSEs also provide a way to assess array augmentation or redesign such as moving buoys to more optimal locations. Examples are shown for buoys off the Aleutian Islands and off the West Coast of South America for impact sites at Hilo HI and along the U.S. West Coast (Crescent City CA and Port San Luis CA). A simple measure (coded green, yellow or red) of the current status of the network's ability to deliver accurate forecasts is proposed to flag the urgency of buoy repair.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |
| **[ICDARTS: Improving the Stability and Performance of Cyclic DARTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00664v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces improvements to the stability and generalizability of Cyclic DARTS (CDARTS). CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>NOTE:...</summary><p>NOTE: This is an expanded version of a previously published conference paper.

However, it suffers from well-known performance collapse due to an inevitable aggregation of skip connections. In this paper, we first disclose that its root cause lies in an unfair advantage in exclusive competition. Through experiments, we show that if either of two conditions is broken, the collapse disappears. Thereby, we present a novel approach called Fair DARTS where the exclusive competition is relaxed to be collaborative. Specifically, we let each operation's architectural weight be independent of others. Yet there is still an important issue of discretization discrepancy. We then propose a zero-one loss to push architectural weights towards zero or one, which approximates an expected multi-hot solution. Our experiments are performed on two mainstream search spaces, and we derive new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although they have been widely adopted and used to tune real-world NAS algorithms, these benchmarks are limited to small search spaces and focus solely on image classification. Recently, several new NAS benchmarks have been introduced that cover significantly larger search spaces over a wide range of tasks, including object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, substantial differences among these NAS benchmarks have so far prevented their widespread adoption, limiting researchers to using just a few benchmarks. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of popular NAS algorithms and performance prediction methods across 25 different combinations of search spaces and datasets, finding that many conclusions drawn from a few NAS benchmarks do not generalize to other benchmarks. To help remedy this problem, we introduce NAS-Bench-Suite, a comprehensive and extensible collection of NAS benchmarks, accessible through a unified interface, created with the aim to facilitate reproducible, generalizable, and rapid NAS research.

The results show that integrating quantization-aware fine-tuning (QAFT) into the NAS loop is a necessary step to find networks that perform well under low-precision quantization: integrating it allows a model size reduction of nearly 50\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. BOMP-NAS is able to find neural networks that achieve state of the art performance at much lower design costs. This study shows that BOMP-NAS can find these neural networks at a 6x shorter search time compared to the closest related work.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRP-NAS: Prediction-based NAS using GCNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08668v4)** | 2021-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) enables researchers to automatically explore broad design spaces in order to improve efficiency of neural networks. This efficiency is especially important in the case of on-device deployment, where improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data selection strategy. We show that our proposed method outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, and that our predictor can consistently learn to extract useful features from the DARTS search space, improving upon the second-order baseline. Finally, to raise awareness of the fact that accurate latency estimation is not a trivial task, we release LatBench -- a latency dataset of NAS-Bench-201 models running on a broad range of devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[TND-NAS: Towards Non-differentiable Objectives in Progressive Differentiable NAS Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03892v4)** | 2023-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search has gradually become the mainstream research topic in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for its high efficiency compared with the early NAS methods. Recent differentiable NAS also aims at further improving the search performance and reducing the GPU-memory consumption. However, these methods are no longer naturally capable of tackling the non-differentiable objectives, e.g., energy, resource-constrained efficiency, and other metrics, let alone the multi-objective search demands. Researches in the multi-objective NAS field target this but requires vast computational resources cause of the sole optimization of each candidate architecture. In light of this discrepancy, we propose the TND-NAS, which is with the merits of the high efficiency in differentiable NAS framework and the compatibility among non-differentiable metrics in Multi-objective NAS. Under the differentiable NAS framework, with the continuous relaxation of the search space, TND-NAS has the architecture parameters been optimized in discrete space, while resorting to the progressive search space shrinking by architecture parameters. Our representative experiment takes two objectives (Parameters, Accuracy) as an example, we achieve a series of high-performance compact architectures on CIFAR10 (1.09M/3.3%, 2.4M/2.95%, 9.57M/2.54%) and CIFAR100 (2.46M/18.3%, 5.46/16.73%, 12.88/15.20%) datasets. Favorably, compared with other multi-objective NAS methods, TND-NAS is less time-consuming (1.3 GPU-days on NVIDIA 1080Ti, 1/6 of that in NSGA-Net), and can be conveniently adapted to real-world NAS scenarios (resource-constrained, platform-specialized).</p></details> |  |
| **[Surrogate NAS Benchmarks: Going Beyond the Limited Search Spaces of Tabular NAS Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09777v4)** | 2022-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most significant barrier to the advancement of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is its demand for large computational resources, which hinders scientifically sound empirical evaluations of NAS methods. Tabular NAS benchmarks have alleviated this problem substantially, making it possible to properly evaluate NAS methods in seconds on commodity machines. However, an unintended consequence of tabular NAS benchmarks has been a focus on extremely small architectural search spaces since their construction relies on exhaustive evaluations of the space. This leads to unrealistic results that do not transfer to larger spaces. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search spaces. We exemplify this approach by creating surrogate NAS benchmarks on the existing tabular NAS-Bench-101 and on two widely used NAS search spaces with up to $10^{21}$ architectures ($10^{13}$ times larger than any previous tabular NAS benchmark). We show that surrogate NAS benchmarks can model the true performance of architectures better than tabular benchmarks (at a small fraction of the cost), that they lead to faithful estimates of how well different NAS methods work on the original non-surrogate benchmark, and that they can generate new scientific insight. We open-source all our code and believe that surrogate NAS benchmarks are an indispensable tool to extend scientifically sound work on NAS to large and exciting search spaces.</p></details> |  |

Few-Shot Adaptation of a NAS Predictor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18451v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search has proven to be a powerful approach to designing and refining neural networks, often boosting their performance and efficiency over manually-designed variations, but comes with computational overhead. While there has been a considerable amount of research focused on lowering the cost of NAS for mainstream tasks, such as image classification, a lot of those improvements stem from the fact that those tasks are well-studied in the broader context. Consequently, applicability of NAS to emerging and under-represented domains is still associated with a relatively high cost and/or uncertainty about the achievable gains. To address this issue, we turn our focus towards the recent growth of publicly available NAS benchmarks in an attempt to extract general NAS knowledge, transferable across different tasks and search spaces. We borrow from the rich field of meta-learning for few-shot adaptation and carefully study applicability of those methods to NAS, with a special focus on the relationship between task-level correlation (domain shift) and predictor transferability; which we deem critical for improving NAS on diverse tasks. In our experiments, we use 6 NAS benchmarks in conjunction, spanning in total 16 NAS settings -- our meta-learning approach not only shows superior (or matching) performance in the cross-validation experiments but also successful extrapolation to a new search space and tasks.</p></details> |  |

Building a high-quality accuracy predictor usually costs enormous computation. To address this issue, instead of using an accuracy predictor, we propose a novel zero-shot index dubbed Zen-Score to rank the architectures. The Zen-Score represents the network expressivity and positively correlates with the model accuracy. The calculation of Zen-Score only takes a few forward inferences through a randomly initialized network, without training network parameters. Built upon the Zen-Score, we further propose a new NAS algorithm, termed as Zen-NAS, by maximizing the Zen-Score of the target network under given inference budgets. Within less than half GPU day, Zen-NAS is able to directly search high performance architectures in a data-free style. Comparing with previous NAS methods, the proposed Zen-NAS is magnitude times faster on multiple server-side and mobile-side GPU platforms with state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet. Our source code and pre-trained models are released on https://github.com/idstcv/ZenNAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCV 2021</p></details> |

The emerging large language models (LLMs), due to their prowess, have also been incorporated into NAS recently and show some promising results. This paper conducts further exploration in this direction by considering three important design metrics simultaneously, i.e., model accuracy, fairness, and hardware deployment efficiency. We propose a novel LLM-based NAS framework, FL-NAS, in this paper, and show experimentally that FL-NAS can indeed find high-performing DNNs, beating state-of-the-art DNN models by orders-of-magnitude across almost all design considerations.</p></details> | ASP-DAC 2024 |
| **[SWAP-NAS: Sample-Wise Activation Patterns for Ultra-fast NAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04161v5)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free metrics (a.k.a. zero-cost proxies) are widely used to avoid resource-intensive neural network training, especially in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Recent studies show that existing training-free metrics have several limitations, such as limited correlation and poor generalisation across different search spaces and tasks. Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT. When integrated with an evolutionary algorithm for NAS, our SWAP-NAS achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in approximately 6 minutes and 9 minutes of GPU time respectively.</p></details> | ICLR2024 Spotlight |

Little progress has been made to systematically understand if the NAS-searched architectures are robust to privacy attacks while abundant work has already shown that human-designed architectures are prone to privacy attacks. In this paper, we fill this gap and systematically measure the privacy risks of NAS architectures. Leveraging the insights from our measurement study, we further explore the cell patterns of cell-based NAS architectures and evaluate how the cell patterns affect the privacy risks of NAS-searched architectures. Through extensive experiments, we shed light on how to design robust NAS architectures against privacy attacks, and also offer a general methodology to understand the hidden correlation between the NAS-searched architectures and other privacy risks.</p></details> | Accepted by CCS 2022 |
| **[BS-NAS: Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS with Searchable Numbers of Channels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09821v1)** | 2020-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-Shot methods have evolved into one of the most popular methods in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) due to weight sharing and single training of a supernet. However, existing methods generally suffer from two issues: predetermined number of channels in each layer which is suboptimal; and model averaging effects and poor ranking correlation caused by weight coupling and continuously expanding search space. To explicitly address these issues, in this paper, a Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS (BS-NAS) framework is proposed, in which `broadening' refers to broadening the search space with a spring block enabling search for numbers of channels during training of the supernet; while `shrinking' refers to a novel shrinking strategy gradually turning off those underperforming operations. The above innovations broaden the search space for wider representation and then shrink it by gradually removing underperforming operations, followed by an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently search for the optimal architecture. Extensive experiments on ImageNet illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed BS-NAS as well as the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 14 pages |

| **[NAS evaluation is frustratingly hard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12522v3)** | 2020-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an exciting new field which promises to be as much as a game-changer as Convolutional Neural Networks were in 2012. Despite many great works leading to substantial improvements on a variety of tasks, comparison between different methods is still very much an open issue. While most algorithms are tested on the same datasets, there is no shared experimental protocol followed by all. As such, and due to the under-use of ablation studies, there is a lack of clarity regarding why certain methods are more effective than others. Our first contribution is a benchmark of $8$ NAS methods on $5$ datasets. To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with different search spaces, we propose using a method's relative improvement over the randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages arising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols. Surprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat the average architecture baseline. We perform further experiments with the commonly used DARTS search space in order to understand the contribution of each component in the NAS pipeline. These experiments highlight that: (i) the use of tricks in the evaluation protocol has a predominant impact on the reported performance of architectures; (ii) the cell-based search space has a very narrow accuracy range, such that the seed has a considerable impact on architecture rankings; (iii) the hand-designed macro-structure (cells) is more important than the searched micro-structure (operations); and (iv) the depth-gap is a real phenomenon, evidenced by the change in rankings between $8$ and $20$ cell architectures. To conclude, we suggest best practices, that we hope will prove useful for the community and help mitigate current NAS pitfalls.

| **[Stronger NAS with Weaker Predictors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10490v3)** | 2021-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) often trains and evaluates a large number of architectures. Recent predictor-based NAS approaches attempt to alleviate such heavy computation costs with two key steps: sampling some architecture-performance pairs and fitting a proxy accuracy predictor. Given limited samples, these predictors, however, are far from accurate to locate top architectures due to the difficulty of fitting the huge search space. This paper reflects on a simple yet crucial question: if our final goal is to find the best architecture, do we really need to model the whole space well?. We propose a paradigm shift from fitting the whole architecture space using one strong predictor, to progressively fitting a search path towards the high-performance sub-space through a set of weaker predictors. As a key property of the weak predictors, their probabilities of sampling better architectures keep increasing. Hence we only sample a few well-performed architectures guided by the previously learned predictor and estimate a new better weak predictor. This embarrassingly easy framework, dubbed WeakNAS, produces coarse-to-fine iteration to gradually refine the ranking of sampling space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WeakNAS costs fewer samples to find top-performance architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictor-based NAS methods, WeakNAS outperforms all with notable margins, e.g., requiring at least 7.5x less samples to find global optimal on NAS-Bench-101. WeakNAS can also absorb their ideas to boost performance more. Further, WeakNAS strikes the new SOTA result of 81.3% in the ImageNet MobileNet Search Space.

| **[HW-NAS-Bench:Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10584v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

| **[Speeding up NAS with Adaptive Subset Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01454v1)** | 2022-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A majority of recent developments in neural architecture search (NAS) have been aimed at decreasing the computational cost of various techniques without affecting their final performance. Towards this goal, several low-fidelity and performance prediction methods have been considered, including those that train only on subsets of the training data. In this work, we present an adaptive subset selection approach to NAS and present it as complementary to state-of-the-art NAS approaches. We uncover a natural connection between one-shot NAS algorithms and adaptive subset selection and devise an algorithm that makes use of state-of-the-art techniques from both areas. We use these techniques to substantially reduce the runtime of DARTS-PT (a leading one-shot NAS algorithm), as well as BOHB and DEHB (leading multifidelity optimization algorithms), without sacrificing accuracy. Our results are consistent across multiple datasets, and towards full reproducibility, we release our code at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/SubsetSelection NAS-B132.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Cost Proxies for Lightweight NAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08134v2)** | 2021-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is quickly becoming the standard methodology to design neural network models. However, NAS is typically compute-intensive because multiple models need to be evaluated before choosing the best one. To reduce the computational power and time needed, a proxy task is often used for evaluating each model instead of full training. In this paper, we evaluate conventional reduced-training proxies and quantify how well they preserve ranking between multiple models during search when compared with the rankings produced by final trained accuracy. We propose a series of zero-cost proxies, based on recent pruning literature, that use just a single minibatch of training data to compute a model's score. Our zero-cost proxies use 3 orders of magnitude less computation but can match and even outperform conventional proxies. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between final validation accuracy and our best zero-cost proxy on NAS-Bench-201 is 0.82, compared to 0.61 for EcoNAS (a recently proposed reduced-training proxy). Finally, we use these zero-cost proxies to enhance existing NAS search algorithms such as random search, reinforcement learning, evolutionary search and predictor-based search. For all search methodologies and across three different NAS datasets, we are able to significantly improve sample efficiency, and thereby decrease computation, by using our zero-cost proxies. For example on NAS-Bench-101, we achieved the same accuracy 4$\times$ quicker than the best previous result.

However, two of the most popular benchmarks do not provide the full training information for each architecture. As a result, on these benchmarks it is not possible to run many types of multi-fidelity techniques, such as learning curve extrapolation, that require evaluating architectures at arbitrary epochs. In this work, we present a method using singular value decomposition and noise modeling to create surrogate benchmarks, NAS-Bench-111, NAS-Bench-311, and NAS-Bench-NLP11, that output the full training information for each architecture, rather than just the final validation accuracy. We demonstrate the power of using the full training information by introducing a learning curve extrapolation framework to modify single-fidelity algorithms, showing that it leads to improvements over popular single-fidelity algorithms which claimed to be state-of-the-art upon release.

We present a technique that allows searching for training proxies that reduce the cost of benchmark construction by significant margins, making it possible to construct realistic NAS benchmarks for large-scale datasets. Using this technique, we construct an open-source bi-objective NAS benchmark for the ImageNet2012 dataset combined with the on-device performance of accelerators, including GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs.

To address this problem, we propose a step-by-step training super-net scheme from one-shot NAS to few-shot NAS. In the training scheme, we firstly train super-net in a one-shot way, and then we disentangle the weights of super-net by splitting them into multi-subnets and training them gradually.

| **[An Efficient NAS-based Approach for Handling Imbalanced Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16972v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class imbalance is a common issue in real-world data distributions, negatively impacting the training of accurate classifiers. Traditional approaches to mitigate this problem fall into three main categories: class re-balancing, information transfer, and representation learning. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance performance on long-tailed datasets by optimizing the backbone architecture through neural architecture search (NAS). Our research shows that an architecture's accuracy on a balanced dataset does not reliably predict its performance on imbalanced datasets. This necessitates a complete NAS run on long-tailed datasets, which can be computationally expensive. To address this computational challenge, we focus on existing work, called IMB-NAS, which proposes efficiently adapting a NAS super-network trained on a balanced source dataset to an imbalanced target dataset. A detailed description of the fundamental techniques for IMB-NAS is provided in this paper, including NAS and architecture transfer. Among various adaptation strategies, we find that the most effective approach is to retrain the linear classification head with reweighted loss while keeping the backbone NAS super-network trained on the balanced source dataset frozen. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments on the imbalanced CIFAR dataset for performance evaluation. Our conclusions are the same as those proposed in the IMB-NAS paper.</p></details> | 7 pages,3 figures |

This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate a number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the search space during the search. Prediction of the networks' performance can alleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for evaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically requires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to obtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS strategy, Predictor-assisted E-NAS (PRE-NAS), which can perform well even with an extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new evolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance over generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the evaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are topologically homogeneous, which circumvents bias and leads to more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a single GPU searching for 0.6 days, competitive architecture can be found by PRE-NAS which achieves 2.40% and 24% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by GECCO 2022</p></details> |
| **[Extensible Proxy for Efficient NAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09459v1)** | 2022-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become a de facto approach in the recent trend of AutoML to design deep neural networks (DNNs). Efficient or near-zero-cost NAS proxies are further proposed to address the demanding computational issues of NAS, where each candidate architecture network only requires one iteration of backpropagation. The values obtained from the proxies are considered the predictions of architecture performance on downstream tasks. However, two significant drawbacks hinder the extended usage of Efficient NAS proxies. (1) Efficient proxies are not adaptive to various search spaces. (2) Efficient proxies are not extensible to multi-modality downstream tasks. Based on the observations, we design a Extensible proxy (Eproxy) that utilizes self-supervised, few-shot training (i.e., 10 iterations of backpropagation) which yields near-zero costs. The key component that makes Eproxy efficient is an untrainable convolution layer termed barrier layer that add the non-linearities to the optimization spaces so that the Eproxy can discriminate the performance of architectures in the early stage. Furthermore, to make Eproxy adaptive to different downstream tasks/search spaces, we propose a Discrete Proxy Search (DPS) to find the optimized training settings for Eproxy with only handful of benchmarked architectures on the target tasks. Our extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of both Eproxy and Eproxy+DPS. Code is available at https://github.com/leeyeehoo/GenNAS-Zero.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficacy of Neural Prediction-Based Zero-Shot NAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16775v3)** | 2023-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prediction-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), performance indicators derived from graph convolutional networks have shown remarkable success. These indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence rate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on each NAS benchmark is transferable to other NAS benchmarks, showing promising generalizability across multiple search spaces.

First, we introduce the integral representation of the classial DiD model, and then extend it to non-additive measures, therefore deriving the formulae for NA-DiD estimation. Then, we give its theoretical properties. Applying NA-DiD to a simulated hospital hygiene intervention, we find that classical DiD can overestimate treatment effects, f.e. failing to account for compliance erosion. In contrast, NA-DiD provides a more accurate estimate by incorporating non-linear aggregation. The Julia implementation of the techniques used and introduced in this article is provided in the appendices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune and Replace NAS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07528v2)** | 2021-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent NAS algorithms are thousands of times faster than the pioneering works, it is often overlooked that they use fewer candidate operations, resulting in a significantly smaller search space. We present PR-DARTS, a NAS algorithm that discovers strong network configurations in a much larger search space and a single day. A small candidate operation pool is used, from which candidates are progressively pruned and replaced with better performing ones. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 achieve 2.51% and 15.53% test error, respectively, despite searching in a space where each cell has 150 times as many possible configurations than in the DARTS baseline.

| **[AnalogNAS-Bench: A NAS Benchmark for Analog In-Memory Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18495v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this, we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the implementations used in this paper can be found at https://github.com/IBM/analog-nas/tree/main/analognasbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Proxy Datasets in NAS approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06905v1)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) defines the design of Neural Networks as a search problem. Unfortunately, NAS is computationally intensive because of various possibilities depending on the number of elements in the design and the possible connections between them. In this work, we extensively analyze the role of the dataset size based on several sampling approaches for reducing the dataset size (unsupervised and supervised cases) as an agnostic approach to reduce search time. We compared these techniques with four common NAS approaches in NAS-Bench-201 in roughly 1,400 experiments on CIFAR-100. One of our surprising findings is that in most cases we can reduce the amount of training data to 25\%, consequently reducing search time to 25\%, while at the same time maintaining the same accuracy as if training on the full dataset. Additionally, some designs derived from subsets out-perform designs derived from the full dataset by up to 22 p.p. accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[BN-NAS: Neural Architecture Search with Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07375v1)** | 2021-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present BN-NAS, neural architecture search with Batch Normalization (BN-NAS), to accelerate neural architecture search (NAS). BN-NAS can significantly reduce the time required by model training and evaluation in NAS. Specifically, for fast evaluation, we propose a BN-based indicator for predicting subnet performance at a very early training stage. The BN-based indicator further facilitates us to improve the training efficiency by only training the BN parameters during the supernet training. This is based on our observation that training the whole supernet is not necessary while training only BN parameters accelerates network convergence for network architecture search. Extensive experiments show that our method can significantly shorten the time of training supernet by more than 10 times and shorten the time of evaluating subnets by more than 600,000 times without losing accuracy.</p></details> | ICCV 2021 |
| **[CE-NAS: An End-to-End Carbon-Efficient Neural Architecture Search Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01414v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2307.04131</p></details> |
| **[Improving One-shot NAS by Suppressing the Posterior Fading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02543v1)** | 2019-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in automated neural architecture search (NAS). To improve the efficiency of NAS, previous approaches adopt weight sharing method to force all models share the same set of weights. However, it has been observed that a model performing better with shared weights does not necessarily perform better when trained alone. In this paper, we analyse existing weight sharing one-shot NAS approaches from a Bayesian point of view and identify the posterior fading problem, which compromises the effectiveness of shared weights. To alleviate this problem, we present a practical approach to guide the parameter posterior towards its true distribution. Moreover, a hard latency constraint is introduced during the search so that the desired latency can be achieved. The resulted method, namely Posterior Convergent NAS (PC-NAS), achieves state-of-the-art performance under standard GPU latency constraint on ImageNet. In our small search space, our model PC-NAS-S attains 76.8 % top-1 accuracy, 2.1% higher than MobileNetV2 (1.4x) with the same latency. When adopted to the large search space, PC-NAS-L achieves 78.1 % top-1 accuracy within 11ms. The discovered architecture also transfers well to other computer vision applications such as object detection and person re-identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[BM-NAS: Bilevel Multimodal Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09379v2)** | 2022-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performances on various multimodal learning problems. However, it often requires huge efforts to adapt DNNs to individual multimodal tasks by manually engineering unimodal features and designing multimodal feature fusion strategies. This paper proposes Bilevel Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel searching scheme. At the upper level, BM-NAS selects the inter/intra-modal feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level, BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention on Attention (AoA). Experimental results on three multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework. BM-NAS achieves competitive performances with much less search time and fewer model parameters in comparison with the existing generalized multimodal NAS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[HM-NAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Hierarchical Masking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00122v2)** | 2019-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of automatic methods, often referred to as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), in designing neural network architectures has recently drawn considerable attention. In this work, we present an efficient NAS approach, named HM- NAS, that generalizes existing weight sharing based NAS approaches. Existing weight sharing based NAS approaches still adopt hand-designed heuristics to generate architecture candidates. As a consequence, the space of architecture candidates is constrained in a subset of all possible architectures, making the architecture search results sub-optimal. HM-NAS addresses this limitation via two innovations. First, HM-NAS incorporates a multi-level architecture encoding scheme to enable searching for more flexible network architectures. Second, it discards the hand-designed heuristics and incorporates a hierarchical masking scheme that automatically learns and determines the optimal architecture. Compared to state-of-the-art weight sharing based approaches, HM-NAS is able to achieve better architecture search performance and competitive model evaluation accuracy. Without the constraint imposed by the hand-designed heuristics, our searched networks contain more flexible and meaningful architectures that existing weight sharing based NAS approaches are not able to discover.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables.

| **[FP-NAS: Fast Probabilistic Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10949v3)** | 2021-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Neural Architecture Search (NAS) requires all layer choices to be held in memory simultaneously; this limits the size of both search space and final architecture. In contrast, Probabilistic NAS, such as PARSEC, learns a distribution over high-performing architectures, and uses only as much memory as needed to train a single model. Nevertheless, it needs to sample many architectures, making it computationally expensive for searching in an extensive space. To solve these problems, we propose a sampling method adaptive to the distribution entropy, drawing more samples to encourage explorations at the beginning, and reducing samples as learning proceeds. Furthermore, to search fast in the multi-variate space, we propose a coarse-to-fine strategy by using a factorized distribution at the beginning which can reduce the number of architecture parameters by over an order of magnitude. We call this method Fast Probabilistic NAS (FP-NAS). Compared with PARSEC, it can sample 64% fewer architectures and search 2.1x faster. Compared with FBNetV2, FP-NAS is 1.9x - 3.5x faster, and the searched models outperform FBNetV2 models on ImageNet. FP-NAS allows us to expand the giant FBNetV2 space to be wider (i.e. larger channel choices) and deeper (i.e. more blocks), while adding Split-Attention block and enabling the search over the number of splits. When searching a model of size 0.4G FLOPS, FP-NAS is 132x faster than EfficientNet, and the searched FP-NAS-L0 model outperforms EfficientNet-B0 by 0.7% accuracy. Without using any architecture surrogate or scaling tricks, we directly search large models up to 1.0G FLOPS. Our FP-NAS-L2 model with simple distillation outperforms BigNAS-XL with advanced in-place distillation by 0.7% accuracy using similar FLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2021 camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[NAS-Bench-360: Benchmarking Neural Architecture Search on Diverse Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05668v6)** | 2023-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) benchmarks and algorithms prioritize well-studied tasks, e.g. image classification on CIFAR or ImageNet. This makes the performance of NAS approaches in more diverse areas poorly understood. In this paper, we present NAS-Bench-360, a benchmark suite to evaluate methods on domains beyond those traditionally studied in architecture search, and use it to address the following question: do state-of-the-art NAS methods perform well on diverse tasks? To construct the benchmark, we curate ten tasks spanning a diverse array of application domains, dataset sizes, problem dimensionalities, and learning objectives. Each task is carefully chosen to interoperate with modern CNN-based search methods while possibly being far-afield from its original development domain. To speed up and reduce the cost of NAS research, for two of the tasks we release the precomputed performance of 15,625 architectures comprising a standard CNN search space. Experimentally, we show the need for more robust NAS evaluation of the kind NAS-Bench-360 enables by showing that several modern NAS procedures perform inconsistently across the ten tasks, with many catastrophically poor results. We also demonstrate how NAS-Bench-360 and its associated precomputed results will enable future scientific discoveries by testing whether several recent hypotheses promoted in the NAS literature hold on diverse tasks.

| **[Generalization Properties of NAS under Activation and Skip Connection Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07238v4)** | 2023-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has fostered the automatic discovery of state-of-the-art neural architectures. Despite the progress achieved with NAS, so far there is little attention to theoretical guarantees on NAS. In this work, we study the generalization properties of NAS under a unifying framework enabling (deep) layer skip connection search and activation function search. To this end, we derive the lower (and upper) bounds of the minimum eigenvalue of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) under the (in)finite-width regime using a certain search space including mixed activation functions, fully connected, and residual neural networks. We use the minimum eigenvalue to establish generalization error bounds of NAS in the stochastic gradient descent training. Importantly, we theoretically and experimentally show how the derived results can guide NAS to select the top-performing architectures, even in the case without training, leading to a train-free algorithm based on our theory. Accordingly, our numerical validation shed light on the design of computationally efficient methods for NAS. Our analysis is non-trivial due to the coupling of various architectures and activation functions under the unifying framework and has its own interest in providing the lower bound of the minimum eigenvalue of NTK in deep learning theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2022</p></details> |
| **[NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00326v2)** | 2020-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved breakthrough success in a great number of applications in the past few years. It could be time to take a step back and analyze the good and bad aspects in the field of NAS. A variety of algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired from the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a DAG. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 candidates in total. The training log and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected candidate and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every candidate also largely improves the efficiency of many methods. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support, we have analyzed it from many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2020 as a spotlight paper; 16 pages; 10 figures; 7 tables; Code is available at https://github.com/D-X-Y/AutoDL-Projects</p></details> |

A popular approach to find fitting networks is through constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), however, previous methods enforce the constraint only softly. Therefore, the resulting networks do not exactly adhere to the resource constraint and their accuracy is harmed. In this work we resolve this by introducing Hard Constrained diffeRentiable NAS (HardCoRe-NAS), that is based on an accurate formulation of the expected resource requirement and a scalable search method that satisfies the hard constraint throughout the search. Our experiments show that HardCoRe-NAS generates state-of-the-art architectures, surpassing other NAS methods, while strictly satisfying the hard resource constraints without any tuning required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Niv N...</summary><p>Niv Nayman and Yonathan Aflalo contributed equally.

| **[Scalable NAS with Factorizable Architectural Parameters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13256v2)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an emerging topic in machine learning and computer vision. The fundamental ideology of NAS is using an automatic mechanism to replace manual designs for exploring powerful network architectures. One of the key factors of NAS is to scale-up the search space, e.g., increasing the number of operators, so that more possibilities are covered, but existing search algorithms often get lost in a large number of operators. For avoiding huge computing and competition among similar operators in the same pool, this paper presents a scalable algorithm by factorizing a large set of candidate operators into smaller subspaces. As a practical example, this allows us to search for effective activation functions along with the regular operators including convolution, pooling, skip-connect, etc. With a small increase in search costs and no extra costs in re-training, we find interesting architectures that were not explored before, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR10 and ImageNet, two standard image classification benchmarks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

NAS methods automate the design of Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) under hardware constraints and they have emerged as key components of AutoML frameworks. However, the NAS problem remains challenging due to the combinatorially large design space and the significant search time (at least 200 GPU-hours). In this work, we alleviate the NAS search cost down to less than 3 hours, while achieving state-of-the-art image classification results under mobile latency constraints. We propose a novel differentiable NAS formulation, namely Single-Path NAS, that uses one single-path over-parameterized ConvNet to encode all architectural decisions based on shared convolutional kernel parameters, hence drastically decreasing the search overhead. Single-Path NAS achieves state-of-the-art top-1 ImageNet accuracy (75.62%), hence outperforming existing mobile NAS methods in similar latency settings (~80ms). In particular, we enhance the accuracy-runtime trade-off in differentiable NAS by treating the Squeeze-and-Excitation path as a fully searchable operation with our novel single-path encoding. Our method has an overall cost of only 8 epochs (24 TPU-hours), which is up to 5,000x faster compared to prior work. Moreover, we study how different NAS formulation choices affect the performance of the designed ConvNets. Furthermore, we exploit the efficiency of our method to answer an interesting question: instead of empirically tuning the hyperparameters of the NAS solver (as in prior work), can we automatically find the hyperparameter values that yield the desired accuracy-runtime trade-off? We open-source our entire codebase at: https://github.com/dstamoulis/single-path-nas.</p></details> | <details><summary>Detai...</summary><p>Detailed extension (journal) of the Single-Path NAS ECMLPKDD'19 paper (arXiv:1904.02877)</p></details> |
