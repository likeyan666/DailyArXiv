| **[DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

One of the key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$ search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity scenarios verify the flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Model Enabled Semantic Communication Based on Robust Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02148v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Long Short-term Memory with Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14955v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[MorphNAS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Morphologically-Aware Multilingual NER](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15836v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morphologically complex languages, particularly multiscript Indian languages, present significant challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This work introduces MorphNAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search framework designed to address these challenges. MorphNAS enhances Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by incorporating linguistic meta-features such as script type and morphological complexity to optimize neural architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER). It automatically identifies optimal micro-architectural elements tailored to language-specific morphology. By automating this search, MorphNAS aims to maximize the proficiency of multilingual NLP models, leading to improved comprehension and processing of these complex languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegimeNAS: Regime-Aware Differentiable Architecture Search With Theoretical Guarantees for Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11338v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2) specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching, transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs). Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive models for challenging financial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architect of the Bits World: Masked Autoregressive Modeling for Circuit Generation Guided by Truth Table](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12751v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic synthesis, a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA), optimizes gate-level circuits to minimize power consumption and area occupancy in integrated circuits (ICs). Traditional logic synthesis tools rely on human-designed heuristics, often yielding suboptimal results. Although differentiable architecture search (DAS) has shown promise in generating circuits from truth tables, it faces challenges such as high computational complexity, convergence to local optima, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Consequently, we propose a novel approach integrating conditional generative models with DAS for circuit generation. Our approach first introduces CircuitVQ, a circuit tokenizer trained based on our Circuit AutoEncoder We then develop CircuitAR, a masked autoregressive model leveraging CircuitVQ as the tokenizer. CircuitAR can generate preliminary circuit structures from truth tables, which guide DAS in producing functionally equivalent circuits. Notably, we observe the scalability and emergent capability in generating complex circuit structures of our CircuitAR models. Extensive experiments also show the superior performance of our method. This research bridges the gap between probabilistic generative models and precise circuit generation, offering a robust solution for logic synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASViT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13079v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025</p></details> |
| **[DNAD: Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20080v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FX-DARTS: Designing Topology-unconstrained Architectures with Differentiable Architecture Search and Entropy-based Super-network Shrinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20079v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16306v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Unsupervised Network Architecture Search Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11140v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in scientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has three main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer. While the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of solution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc, leaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an unsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed PINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to find the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural networks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture parameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of PINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our approach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior usage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as the associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on several benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers' equations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS achieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting observation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a prominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that architectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior performance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.</p></details> |  |
| **[EM-DARTS: Hierarchical Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14432v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics has received increasing attention thanks to its highly secure identification. Although deep learning (DL) models have shown success in eye movement recognition, their architectures largely rely on human prior knowledge. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DARTS) automates the manual process of architecture design with high search efficiency. However, DARTS typically stacks multiple cells to form a convolutional network, which limits the diversity of architecture. Furthermore, DARTS generally searches for architectures using shallower networks than those used in the evaluation, creating a significant disparity in architecture depth between the search and evaluation phases. To address this issue, we propose EM-DARTS, a hierarchical differentiable architecture search algorithm to automatically design the DL architecture for eye movement recognition. First, we define a supernet and propose a global and local alternate Neural Architecture Search method to search the optimal architecture alternately with a differentiable neural architecture search. The local search strategy aims to find an optimal architecture for different cells while the global search strategy is responsible for optimizing the architecture of the target network. To minimize redundancy, transfer entropy is proposed to compute the information amount of each layer, thereby further simplifying the network search process. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EM-DARTS is capable of producing an optimal architecture that leads to state-of-the-art recognition performance, {Specifically, the recognition models developed using EM-DARTS achieved the lowest EERs of 0.0453 on the GazeBase dataset, 0.0377 on the JuDo1000 dataset, and 0.1385 on the EMglasses dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submited to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Channel Allocation for Robust Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04681v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has attracted much attention due to its simplicity and significant improvement in efficiency. However, the excessive accumulation of the skip connection, when training epochs become large, makes it suffer from weak stability and low robustness, thus limiting its practical applications. Many works have attempted to restrict the accumulation of skip connections by indicators or manual design. These methods, however, are susceptible to human priors and hyper-parameters. In this work, we suggest a more subtle and direct approach that no longer explicitly searches for skip connections in the search stage, based on the paradox that skip connections were proposed to guarantee the performance of very deep networks, but the networks in the search stage of differentiable architecture search are actually very shallow. Instead, by introducing channel importance ranking and channel allocation strategy, the skip connections are implicitly searched and automatically refilled unimportant channels in the evaluation stage. Our method, dubbed Adaptive Channel Allocation (ACA) strategy, is a general-purpose approach for differentiable architecture search, which universally works in DARTS variants without introducing human priors, indicators, or hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments on various datasets and DARTS variants verify that the ACA strategy is the most effective one among existing methods in improving robustness and dealing with the collapse issue when training epochs become large.</p></details> | Accepted by TNNLS |
| **[An Architectural Approach to Enhance Deep Long-Tailed Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06098v3)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep long-tailed recognition has been widely studied to address the issue of imbalanced data distributions in real-world scenarios. However, there has been insufficient focus on the design of neural architectures, despite empirical evidence suggesting that architecture can significantly impact performance. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate long-tailed issues through architectural improvements. To simplify the design process, we utilize Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, existing DARTS methods struggle to perform well in long-tailed scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Long-Tailed Differential Architecture Search (LTDAS). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to explore architectural components that demonstrate better performance on long-tailed data and propose a new search space based on our observations. This ensures that the architecture obtained through our search process incorporates superior components. Additionally, we propose replacing the learnable linear classifier with an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to further enhance our method. This classifier effectively alleviates the biased search process and prevents performance collapse. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently improves upon existing methods from an orthogonal perspective and achieves state-of-the-art results with simple enhancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable architecture search with multi-dimensional attention for spiking neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00902v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained enormous popularity in the field of artificial intelligence due to their low power consumption. However, the majority of SNN methods directly inherit the structure of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), usually leading to sub-optimal model performance in SNNs. To alleviate this problem, we integrate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method and propose Multi-Attention Differentiable Architecture Search (MA-DARTS) to directly automate the search for the optimal network structure of SNNs. Initially, we defined a differentiable two-level search space and conducted experiments within micro architecture under a fixed layer. Then, we incorporated a multi-dimensional attention mechanism and implemented the MA-DARTS algorithm in this search space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification compared to other methods under the same parameters with 94.40% accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset and 76.52% accuracy on CIFAR100 dataset. Additionally, we monitored and assessed the number of spikes (NoS) in each cell during the whole experiment. Notably, the number of spikes of the whole model stabilized at approximately 110K in validation and 100k in training on datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[OStr-DARTS: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search based on Operation Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14433v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has emerged as a promising technique for effective neural architecture search, and it mainly contains two steps to find the high-performance architecture: First, the DARTS supernet that consists of mixed operations will be optimized via gradient descent. Second, the final architecture will be built by the selected operations that contribute the most to the supernet. Although DARTS improves the efficiency of NAS, it suffers from the well-known degeneration issue which can lead to deteriorating architectures. Existing works mainly attribute the degeneration issue to the failure of its supernet optimization, while little attention has been paid to the selection method. In this paper, we cease to apply the widely-used magnitude-based selection method and propose a novel criterion based on operation strength that estimates the importance of an operation by its effect on the final loss. We show that the degeneration issue can be effectively addressed by using the proposed criterion without any modification of supernet optimization, indicating that the magnitude-based selection method can be a critical reason for the instability of DARTS. The experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relax DARTS: Relaxing the Constraints of Differentiable Architecture Search for Eye Movement Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11652v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eye movement biometrics is a secure and innovative identification method. Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $\alpha$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $\beta$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CCBR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Learning Rate Scheduling for Neural Architecture Search on Long-Tailed Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07028v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we attempt to address the challenge of applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms, specifically the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), to long-tailed datasets where class distribution is highly imbalanced. We observe that traditional re-sampling and re-weighting techniques, which are effective in standard classification tasks, lead to performance degradation when combined with DARTS. To mitigate this, we propose a novel adaptive learning rate scheduling strategy tailored for the architecture parameters of DARTS when integrated with the Bilateral Branch Network (BBN) for handling imbalanced datasets. Our approach dynamically adjusts the learning rate of the architecture parameters based on the training epoch, preventing the disruption of well-trained representations in the later stages of training. Additionally, we explore the impact of branch mixing factors on the algorithm's performance. Through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an artificially induced long-tailed distribution, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to using DARTS alone. And the experiment results suggest that re-sampling methods inherently harm the performance of the DARTS algorithm. Our findings highlight the importance of careful data augment when applying DNAS to imbalanced learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient NAS with FaDE on Hierarchical Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16218v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a challenging problem. Hierarchical search spaces allow for cheap evaluations of neural network sub modules to serve as surrogate for architecture evaluations. Yet, sometimes the hierarchy is too restrictive or the surrogate fails to generalize. We present FaDE which uses differentiable architecture search to obtain relative performance predictions on finite regions of a hierarchical NAS space. The relative nature of these ranks calls for a memory-less, batch-wise outer search algorithm for which we use an evolutionary algorithm with pseudo-gradient descent. FaDE is especially suited on deep hierarchical, respectively multi-cell search spaces, which it can explore by linear instead of exponential cost and therefore eliminates the need for a proxy search space. Our experiments show that firstly, FaDE-ranks on finite regions of the search space correlate with corresponding architecture performances and secondly, the ranks can empower a pseudo-gradient evolutionary search on the complete neural architecture search space.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel NAS framework based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE) that eliminates the need for labeled data during the search process. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the robust discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method in the unsupervised paradigm by introducing a multi-scale decoder. Through extensive experiments conducted on various search spaces and datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, providing empirical evidence of its superiority over baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[emoDARTS: Joint Optimisation of CNN & Sequential Neural Network Architectures for Superior Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14083v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance. While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing on February 19, 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.14402</p></details> |

However, the optimal approach and the placement of PEFT methods remain inconclusive. Our study conducts extensive experiments to compare different PEFT methods and their layer-wise placement adapting Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). We also explore the use of ensemble learning to leverage diverse PEFT strategies. The results reveal that DARTS does not outperform the baseline approach, which involves inserting the same PEFT method into all layers of a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model. In contrast, an ensemble learning approach, particularly one employing majority voting, demonstrates superior performance. Our statistical evidence indicates that different PEFT methods learn in varied ways. This variation might explain why the synergistic integration of various PEFT methods through ensemble learning can harness their unique learning capabilities more effectively compared to individual layer-wise optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024 Self-supervision in Audio, Speech and Beyond (SASB) workshop</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have substantially enhanced the performance of SER models through increased model complexity. However, designing optimal DL architectures requires prior experience and experimental evaluations. Encouragingly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a promising avenue to determine an optimal DL model automatically. In particular, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient method of using NAS to search for optimised models. This paper proposes a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and LSTM architecture, to improve SER performance, where the literature informs the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to offer improved performance. While DARTS has previously been applied to CNN and LSTM combinations, our approach introduces a novel mechanism, particularly in selecting CNN operations using DARTS. In contrast to previous studies, we refrain from imposing constraints on the order of the layers for the CNN within the DARTS cell; instead, we allow DARTS to determine the optimal layer order autonomously. Experimenting with the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significantly higher SER accuracy than hand-engineering the CNN-LSTM configuration. It also outperforms the best-reported SER results achieved using DARTS on CNN-LSTM.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

However, despite the increasing amount of new forecasting architectures, it is still unclear if we have leveraged the full potential of these existing modules within a properly designed architecture. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical neural architecture search approach for time series forecasting tasks. With the design of a hierarchical search space, we incorporate many architecture types designed for forecasting tasks and allow for the efficient combination of different forecasting architecture modules. Results on long-term-time-series-forecasting tasks show that our approach can search for lightweight high-performing forecasting architectures across different forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Attention Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13251v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |
| **[An Integrated Approach to Neural Architecture Search for Deep Q-Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19872v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training. This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as a dynamic component of the learning process itself.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and support personalized care, modeling such heterogeneous data presents significant technical challenges. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 69 studies to identify common obstacles, including missing modalities, limited sample sizes, dimensionality imbalance, interpretability issues, and finding the optimal fusion techniques. We highlight recent methodological advances, such as transfer learning, generative models, attention mechanisms, and neural architecture search that offer promising solutions. By mapping current trends and innovations, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the field and offers practical insights to guide future research and development in multimodal modeling for medical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELASTIC: Efficient Once For All Iterative Search for Object Detection on Microcontrollers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21999v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying high-performance object detectors on TinyML platforms poses significant challenges due to tight hardware constraints and the modular complexity of modern detection pipelines. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SGM: A Statistical Godel Machine for Risk-Controlled Recursive Self-Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10232v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code; however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings. We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level, while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems.Code is available at: https://github.com/gravitywavelet/sgm-anon.</p></details> |  |
| **[GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20725v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[PlatformX: An End-to-End Transferable Platform for Energy-Efficient Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08993v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations, enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and (iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings), Project Page: https://kaist-dmlab.github.io/MONAQ</p></details> |

| **[DART: A Structured Dataset of Regulatory Drug Documents in Italian for Clinical NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18475v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support. However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub: https://github.com/PRAISELab-PicusLab/DART.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The content-agnostic, fixed-grid tokenizers used by standard large-scale vision models like Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) represent a fundamental performance bottleneck, creating a trade-off between capturing fine-grained detail and suffering from redundant computation. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce DART, a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer. DART employs learnable region scores and quantile-based partitioning to create content-aware patches of varying sizes, intelligently allocating a higher token density to information-rich regions. The impact of this approach is profound: it unlocks a more intelligent scaling paradigm, where a DART-equipped DeiT-Small (22M parameters) matches the performance of a DeiT-Base (86M) with nearly double the inference speed by efficiently capturing high-resolution details in key regions. Furthermore, the principle of adaptive tokenization proves its generality with clear benefits in dense prediction and spatiotemporal video tasks. We argue that by resolving the tokenizer bottleneck at its source, adaptive tokenization is a key component for building the next generation of more efficient and capable foundation models for multimodal AI, robotics, and content generation.

| **[DART: Distilling Autoregressive Reasoning to Silent Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11752v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant performance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without extra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05585v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART) framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

State-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID, thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.</p></details> |  |

A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices $a, b, c, d, e$ and edges $ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de$. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ contains a set $X$ of vertices such that $X$ meets all largest cliques of $H$, and $X$ induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph $G$ is bounded by $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of $G$. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</p></details> |  |

However, existing designs are typically single-mode: either safeguarded by propeller guards that prevent deformation or deformable but lacking rigidity, which is crucial for stable flight in open environments. This paper introduces DART, a Dual-stiffness Aerial RoboT, that adapts its post-collision response by either engaging a locking mechanism for a rigid mode or disengaging it for a flexible mode, respectively. Comprehensive characterization tests highlight the significant difference in post collision responses between its rigid and flexible modes, with the rigid mode offering seven times higher stiffness compared to the flexible mode. To understand and harness the collision dynamics, we propose a novel collision response prediction model based on the linear complementarity system theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of predicting collision forces for both the rigid and flexible modes of DART. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the model and underscore its potential to advance collision-inclusive trajectory planning in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous approaches for radiology report generation have shown impressive performance. However, there remains significant potential to improve accuracy by ensuring that retrieved reports contain disease-relevant findings similar to those in the X-ray images and by refining generated reports. In this study, we propose a Disease-aware image-text Alignment and self-correcting Re-alignment for Trustworthy radiology report generation (DART) framework. In the first stage, we generate initial reports based on image-to-text retrieval with disease-matching, embedding both images and texts in a shared embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures the retrieval of reports with similar disease-relevant findings that closely align with the input X-ray images. In the second stage, we further enhance the initial reports by introducing a self-correction module that re-aligns them with the X-ray images. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used benchmarks, surpassing previous approaches in both report generation and clinical efficacy metrics, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness of radiology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |

Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance of detecting black-box LLMs is low because existing models focus on probabilistic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and which may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted three experiments to test the performance of DART. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without probabilistic features and the origin of AIGT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[DART: Denoising Autoregressive Transformer for Scalable Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08159v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the dominant approach for visual generation. They are trained by denoising a Markovian process which gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.</p></details> | Preprint |

While real-world data collection effort exist, requirements for robot hardware, physical environment setups, and frequent resets significantly impede the scalability needed for modern learning frameworks. We introduce DART, a teleoperation platform designed for crowdsourcing that reimagines robotic data collection by leveraging cloud-based simulation and augmented reality (AR) to address many limitations of prior data collection efforts. Our user studies highlight that DART enables higher data collection throughput and lower physical fatigue compared to real-world teleoperation. We also demonstrate that policies trained using DART-collected datasets successfully transfer to reality and are robust to unseen visual disturbances. All data collected through DART is automatically stored in our cloud-hosted database, DexHub, which will be made publicly available upon curation, paving the path for DexHub to become an ever-growing data hub for robot learning.

Deep learning methods have shown good performance, but their network architecture relies on manual design and combined priori knowledge. To address these issues, we introduce automated network search (NAS) algorithms to the field of eye movement recognition and present Relax DARTS, which is an improvement of the Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to realize more efficient network search and training. The key idea is to circumvent the issue of weight sharing by independently training the architecture parameters $\alpha$ to achieve a more precise target architecture. Moreover, the introduction of module input weights $\beta$ allows cells the flexibility to select inputs, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon and improve the model performance. Results on four public databases demonstrate that the Relax DARTS achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance. Notably, Relax DARTS exhibits adaptability to other multi-feature temporal classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By CCBR 2024</p></details> |
| **[DART: A Solution for Decentralized Federated Learning Model Robustness Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08652v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to address privacy concerns inherent in Machine Learning (ML) practices. However, conventional FL methods, particularly those following the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, utilize a central server for global aggregation, which exhibits limitations such as bottleneck and single point of failure. To address these issues, the Decentralized FL (DFL) paradigm has been proposed, which removes the client-server boundary and enables all participants to engage in model training and aggregation tasks. Nevertheless, as CFL, DFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably poisoning attacks that undermine model performance. While existing research on model robustness has predominantly focused on CFL, there is a noteworthy gap in understanding the model robustness of the DFL paradigm. In this paper, a thorough review of poisoning attacks targeting the model robustness in DFL systems, as well as their corresponding countermeasures, are presented. Additionally, a solution called DART is proposed to evaluate the robustness of DFL models, which is implemented and integrated into a DFL platform. Through extensive experiments, this paper compares the behavior of CFL and DFL under diverse poisoning attacks, pinpointing key factors affecting attack spread and effectiveness within the DFL. It also evaluates the performance of different defense mechanisms and investigates whether defense mechanisms designed for CFL are compatible with DFL. The empirical results provide insights into research challenges and suggest ways to improve the robustness of DFL models for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Bayes Approach for Estimating Skill Models for Professional Darts Players](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10750v3)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform an exploratory data analysis on a data-set for the top 16 professional darts players from the 2019 season. We use this data-set to fit player skill models which can then be used in dynamic zero-sum games (ZSGs) that model real-world matches between players. We propose an empirical Bayesian approach based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) model that overcomes limitations in the data. Specifically we introduce two DM-based skill models where the first model borrows strength from other darts players and the second model borrows strength from other regions of the dartboard. We find these DM-based models outperform simpler benchmark models with respect to Brier and Spherical scores, both of which are proper scoring rules. We also show in ZSGs settings that the difference between DM-based skill models and the simpler benchmark models is practically significant. Finally, we use our DM-model to analyze specific situations that arose in real-world darts matches during the 2019 season.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.11031</p></details> |
| **[Applicability of oculomics for individual risk prediction: Repeatability and robustness of retinal Fractal Dimension using DART and AutoMorph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06950v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To investigate whether Fractal Dimension (FD)-based oculomics could be used for individual risk prediction by evaluating repeatability and robustness. Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter {\lambda} which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median {\lambda} in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with {\lambda} (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.</p></details> |  |

However, simulating realistic radar scans is a challenging task that requires an accurate model of the scene, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Rather than specifying these models explicitly, we propose DART - Doppler Aided Radar Tomography, a Neural Radiance Field-inspired method which uses radar-specific physics to create a reflectance and transmittance-based rendering pipeline for range-Doppler images. We then evaluate DART by constructing a custom data collection platform and collecting a novel radar dataset together with accurate position and instantaneous velocity measurements from lidar-based localization. In comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, DART synthesizes superior radar range-Doppler images from novel views across all datasets and additionally can be used to generate high quality tomographic images.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024; see https://wiselabcmu.github.io/dart/ for our project site</p></details> |
| **[DART: Depth-Enhanced Accurate and Real-Time Background Matting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15820v1)** | 2024-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matting with a static background, often referred to as ``Background Matting" (BGM), has garnered significant attention within the computer vision community due to its pivotal role in various practical applications like webcasting and photo editing. Nevertheless, achieving highly accurate background matting remains a formidable challenge, primarily owing to the limitations inherent in conventional RGB images. These limitations manifest in the form of susceptibility to varying lighting conditions and unforeseen shadows. In this paper, we leverage the rich depth information provided by the RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras to enhance background matting performance in real-time, dubbed DART. Firstly, we adapt the original RGB-based BGM algorithm to incorporate depth information. The resulting model's output undergoes refinement through Bayesian inference, incorporating a background depth prior. The posterior prediction is then translated into a "trimap," which is subsequently fed into a state-of-the-art matting algorithm to generate more precise alpha mattes. To ensure real-time matting capabilities, a critical requirement for many real-world applications, we distill the backbone of our model from a larger and more versatile BGM network. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Moreover, thanks to the distillation operation, our method achieves a remarkable processing speed of 33 frames per second (fps) on a mid-range edge-computing device. This high efficiency underscores DART's immense potential for deployment in mobile applications}</p></details> |  |
| **[DART: A Principled Approach to Adversarially Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11120v1)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts and adversarial examples are two major challenges for deploying machine learning models. While these challenges have been studied individually, their combination is an important topic that remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study the problem of adversarial robustness under a common setting of distribution shift - unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Specifically, given a labeled source domain $D_S$ and an unlabeled target domain $D_T$ with related but different distributions, the goal is to obtain an adversarially robust model for $D_T$. The absence of target domain labels poses a unique challenge, as conventional adversarial robustness defenses cannot be directly applied to $D_T$. To address this challenge, we first establish a generalization bound for the adversarial target loss, which consists of (i) terms related to the loss on the data, and (ii) a measure of worst-case domain divergence. Motivated by this bound, we develop a novel unified defense framework called Divergence Aware adveRsarial Training (DART), which can be used in conjunction with a variety of standard UDA methods; e.g., DANN [Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015]. DART is applicable to general threat models, including the popular $\ell_p$-norm model, and does not require heuristic regularizers or architectural changes. We also release DomainRobust: a testbed for evaluating robustness of UDA models to adversarial attacks. DomainRobust consists of 4 multi-domain benchmark datasets (with 46 source-target pairs) and 7 meta-algorithms with a total of 11 variants. Our large-scale experiments demonstrate that on average, DART significantly enhances model robustness on all benchmarks compared to the state of the art, while maintaining competitive standard accuracy. The relative improvement in robustness from DART reaches up to 29.2% on the source-target domain pairs considered.</p></details> |  |

Our goal was to design a small-scale car-like robot equipped with all the hardware needed for on-board navigation and control while keeping it cost-effective and easy to replicate. To develop DART, we built on an existing off-the-shelf model and augmented its sensor suite to improve its capabilities for control and motion planning tasks. We detail the hardware setup and the system identification challenges to derive the vehicle's models. Furthermore, we present some use cases where we used DART to test different motion planning applications to show the versatility of the platform. Finally, we provide a git repository with all the details to replicate DART, complete with a simulation environment and the data used for system identification.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

This approach applies continuous relaxation of network representation to construct a weight-sharing supernet and enables the identification of excellent subnets in just a few GPU days. However, performance collapse in DARTS results in deteriorating architectures filled with parameter-free operations and remains a great challenge to the robustness. To resolve this problem, we reveal that the fundamental reason is the biased estimation of the candidate importance in the search space through theoretical and experimental analysis, and more precisely select operations via information-based measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excessive concern over the supernet and inefficient utilization of data in bi-level optimization also account for suboptimal results. We adopt a more realistic objective focusing on the performance of subnets and simplify it with the help of the information-based measurements. Finally, we explain theoretically why progressively shrinking the width of the supernet is necessary and reduce the approximation error of optimal weights in DARTS. Our proposed method, named IS-DARTS, comprehensively improves DARTS and resolves the aforementioned problems. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS-based search space demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-DARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2024, paper + supplementary, 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[ICDARTS: Improving the Stability and Performance of Cyclic DARTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00664v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces improvements to the stability and generalizability of Cyclic DARTS (CDARTS). CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>NOTE:...</summary><p>NOTE: This is an expanded version of a previously published conference paper.

| **[Word Sense Disambiguation as a Game of Neurosymbolic Darts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16663v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the hardest tasks in natural language understanding and knowledge engineering. The glass ceiling of 80% F1 score is recently achieved through supervised deep-learning, enriched by a variety of knowledge graphs. Here, we propose a novel neurosymbolic methodology that is able to push the F1 score above 90%. The core of our methodology is a neurosymbolic sense embedding, in terms of a configuration of nested balls in n-dimensional space. The centre point of a ball well-preserves word embedding, which partially fix the locations of balls. Inclusion relations among balls precisely encode symbolic hypernym relations among senses, and enable simple logic deduction among sense embeddings, which cannot be realised before. We trained a Transformer to learn the mapping from a contextualized word embedding to its sense ball embedding, just like playing the game of darts (a game of shooting darts into a dartboard). A series of experiments are conducted by utilizing pre-training n-ball embeddings, which have the coverage of around 70% training data and 75% testing data in the benchmark WSD corpus. The F1 scores in experiments range from 90.1% to 100.0% in all six groups of test data-sets (each group has 4 testing data with different sizes of n-ball embeddings). Our novel neurosymbolic methodology has the potential to break the ceiling of deep-learning approaches for WSD. Limitations and extensions of our current works are listed.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: Double Attention Reference-based Transformer for Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08837v1)** | 2023-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DARTS, a transformer model for reference-based image super-resolution. DARTS learns joint representations of two image distributions to enhance the content of low-resolution input images through matching correspondences learned from high-resolution reference images. Current state-of-the-art techniques in reference-based image super-resolution are based on a multi-network, multi-stage architecture. In this work, we adapt the double attention block from the GAN literature, processing the two visual streams separately and combining self-attention and cross-attention blocks through a gating attention strategy. Our work demonstrates how the attention mechanism can be adapted for the particular requirements of reference-based image super-resolution, significantly simplifying the architecture and training pipeline. We show that our transformer-based model performs competitively with state-of-the-art models, while maintaining a simpler overall architecture and training process. In particular, we obtain state-of-the-art on the SUN80 dataset, with a PSNR/SSIM of 29.83 / .809. These results show that attention alone is sufficient for the RSR task, without multiple purpose-built subnetworks, knowledge distillation, or multi-stage training.</p></details> |  |

However, DARTS is brittle to the catastrophic failure incurred by the skip connection in the search space. Recent studies also cast doubt on the basic underlying hypotheses of DARTS which are argued to be inherently prone to the performance discrepancy between the continuous-relaxed supernet in the training phase and the discretized finalnet in the evaluation phase. We figure out that the robustness problem and the skepticism can both be explained by the information bypass leakage during the training of the supernet. This naturally highlights the vital role of the sparsity of architecture parameters in the training phase which has not been well developed in the past. We thus propose a novel sparse-regularized approximation and an efficient mixed-sparsity training scheme to robustify DARTS by eliminating the information bypass leakage. We subsequently conduct extensive experiments on multiple search spaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as full paper on ICDM 2021</p></details> |

We observe some recent studies already suffer from this issue that overshadows the meaning of scores. In this work, we first propose and orchestrate a suite of improvements to frame a larger and harder DSS, termed LHD, while retaining high efficiency in search. We step forward to renovate a LHD-based new benchmark, taking care of both discernibility and accessibility. Specifically, we re-implement twelve baselines and evaluate them across twelve conditions by combining two underexpolored influential factors: transductive robustness and discretization policy, to reasonably construct a benchmark upon multi-condition evaluation. Considering that the tabular benchmarks are always insufficient to adequately evaluate the methods of neural architecture search (NAS), our work can serve as a crucial basis for the future progress of NAS. https://github.com/chaoji90/LHD</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2023</p></details> |

Common training strategies to improve generalization involve the use of data augmentations, ensembling and model averaging. In this work, we first establish a surprisingly simple but strong benchmark for generalization which utilizes diverse augmentations within a training minibatch, and show that this can learn a more balanced distribution of features. Further, we propose Diversify-Aggregate-Repeat Training (DART) strategy that first trains diverse models using different augmentations (or domains) to explore the loss basin, and further Aggregates their weights to combine their expertise and obtain improved generalization. We find that Repeating the step of Aggregation throughout training improves the overall optimization trajectory and also ensures that the individual models have a sufficiently low loss barrier to obtain improved generalization on combining them. We shed light on our approach by casting it in the framework proposed by Shen et al. and theoretically show that it indeed generalizes better. In addition to improvements in In- Domain generalization, we demonstrate SOTA performance on the Domain Generalization benchmarks in the popular DomainBed framework as well. Our method is generic and can easily be integrated with several base training algorithms to achieve performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

In this paper, we raise an interesting problem: can we properly measure the operation importance in DARTS through a training-free way, with avoiding the parameter-intensive bias? We investigate this question through the lens of edge connectivity, and provide an affirmative answer by defining a connectivity concept, ZERo-cost Operation Sensitivity (ZEROS), to score the importance of candidate operations in DARTS at initialization. By devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable architecture search (FreeDARTS). Based on the theory of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we show the proposed connectivity score provably negatively correlated with the generalization bound of DARTS supernet after convergence under gradient descent training. In addition, we theoretically explain how ZEROS implicitly avoids parameter-intensive bias in selecting architectures, and empirically show the searched architectures by FreeDARTS are of comparable size. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a series of search spaces, and results have demonstrated that FreeDARTS is a reliable and efficient baseline for neural architecture search.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised version with more theoretical analysis</p></details> |

Since the introduction of DARTS, there has been little work done on adapting the action space based on state-of-art architecture design principles for CNNs. In this work, we aim to address this gap by incrementally augmenting the DARTS search space with micro-design changes inspired by ConvNeXt and studying the trade-off between accuracy, evaluation layer count, and computational cost. We introduce the Pseudo-Inverted Bottleneck Conv (PIBConv) block intending to reduce the computational footprint of the inverted bottleneck block proposed in ConvNeXt. Our proposed architecture is much less sensitive to evaluation layer count and outperforms a DARTS network with similar size significantly, at layer counts as small as 2. Furthermore, with less layers, not only does it achieve higher accuracy with lower computational footprint (measured in GMACs) and parameter count, GradCAM comparisons show that our network can better detect distinctive features of target objects compared to DARTS.

To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.</p></details> |  |

To address this, Meta Neural Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones. Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines, achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, the extensive search space and high computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on accelerator-specific architecture. Our experimental results show that Coflex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from 1.9x to 9.5x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD); 9 pages, including 6 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |

However, the field faces two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed.
